And let me welcome our witnesses joining us in person today. From the left, as I look at our witnesses, we have&nbsp;Gareth Wilson, who is a Celestia leaseholder; Mark Thomas, also at Celestia and a member of Welsh Cladiators; Robert Nicholls, from Altamar Swansea and founder of Swansea Cladiators and a member of the Welsh Cladiators; and Geoff Spight, Altamar in Swansea also, and also a member of the Welsh Cladiators. Welcome to you all\u2014croeso. Let me begin with one or two initial questions before we move to other members of the committee. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Oh, yes, sorry, you are making a presentation initially, aren't you? I'm sorry. Who will present to us?\n\nMark Thomas: I will, Chair. And could I just confirm the timing, because I know you have a very busy agenda?\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: We have one hour in total for this evidence session, but a brief presentation to begin with is absolutely fine.\n\nMark Thomas: Sure, okay. So, first of all, diolch,&nbsp;thank you very much for your time. We realise you're very busy. We very much appreciate the opportunity of appearing before you. We would like to just make a quick presentation to give an overview of where we think we are now, because we remain deeply concerned about the slow progress that we're making in Wales on this crisis.However, in addition to thanking yourself, I'd also like to thank and make a public thanks to our colleagues in the Welsh fire and rescue services, because, in our view, they've been magnificent in supporting us over the last few years and, to some extent, as we'll come on to, they are also a victim of this crisis in terms of the pressure and workload that has been put on them, but we'd like to express our gratitude and thanks for their professionalism and support.The key thing I think that we want to emphasise today is the need for urgency with regard to this crisis. I think by now we'll know that on 14 June of this year it will be six years since the Grenfell tragedy. Six years is an awfully long time, and we remain deeply concerned about the slow rate of progress in Wales. And with that in mind, we recognise that none of us want to be here today. I'm supposed to be retired, Gareth has retired, and we have a lot of different victims caught up in this crisis. We're also clearly of the view that the crisis is not of our making, it's not of the making of the people that we propose to represent, and neither do we think it's the making of the Welsh Government. Developers and builders created this problem. But, at the same time, one of our concerns is that there seems to be a lack of understanding of the impact that this crisis is having on many hundreds of decent, ordinary people who did the right thing. They worked hard to prepare often for, like myself, a pension, to get on the housing ladder et cetera, et cetera, and they had surveys done, they bought what they thought were effective properties, and they've turned out to be disasters.And the range of victims, as you can see, is very, very high. We have pensioners whose pension plans&nbsp;are in turmoil, we have many young people. I know, in some blocks, people have had to move on, because they're trying to start a family; they need to move in order to change careers or jobs, and they're stuck. So, there are many different victims of this crisis. And I want to remind you here\u2014if I can just refer to this, because I can't see your screen; too far away\u2014that this was a letter sent from a leaseholder I know. He's in his mid to late 70s. He's a retired teacher who has done everything correct in his life, and he and his wife live just four minutes away from here, and this is a letter they wrote to Julie James back in December 2020 about the effect the crisis was having on their life. And personally, I know this gentleman; I'm not going to name him, because I don't want to embarrass him, but I have seen physically in his face and his mental condition the impact that the worry that this crisis has had. And just as that gentleman in 2020 urged Julie James to recognise that, we think that is being lost in this whole issue\u2014the human cost. And one of the fundamental problems that we think is at play here is that, as I'm sure many of you know, the corporate entity is a very tough animal. It only understands two things: it responds to the law of the land and profit erosion. And profit erosion is often competitor activity, customers moving away or Government regulation. And it's quite clear that developers have been incredibly profitable over the last decade or two in the United Kingdom, and there's a figure there\u2014they've made profits equalling \u00a331 billion in the last 10 years. So, these are people who can afford to repair our fire and build-defective homes. It's not a question of the Government needing to fund this; developers have the money to fund it.But the problem we have\u2014and we've lived this now, or I've lived this, almost seven days a week for the last four years\u2014is the corporate leadership of the companies involved. Their salaries are not based on responding to our needs. They only respond to the force of law, and I'd like to come back to that, because that's a key issue and concern we have about how we're currently approaching the problem in Wales, as opposed to the actions that are being taken in England. And just to illustrate that\u2014I won't go through every one of these\u2014it is concerning that, in recent times, the Minister, Julie James, has repeatedly thanked and commended developers for signing her pact and co-operating. And we get a lot of very positive words from developers, and you'll see down in the bottom right hand\u2014I think this comes, maybe, Gareth, from the pact or the pledge\u2014it talks about working in 'Good Faith', 'Work Constructively', 'No Liability', 'At Pace', 'Be Assured', 'As quickly as reasonably possible' and 'Within one month deliver a proposal'. And we have this very stark contrast between people using a lot of nice positive rhetoric and their feet moving in a different direction. So, at the same time that Richard Akers, the chairman of Redrow, is saying lots of positive things, I and my own development are in deep litigation with that company, which we don't want to be involved in. So, our whole approach is that, for years, developers have obfuscated and deflected responsibility for this crisis. The only thing that makes them move is legislation, and that's quite key. And I'd also\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Yes.\n\nGareth Wilson: If I could just make one comment while we've got this slide up, because it's a very interesting thing. But, in those quotes that Mark just ran through, which come from the pact and pledge, which are identical, essentially, the last one has an actual date or time in it: 'Within one month deliver a proposal', and that is the one thing that has not happened. The one concrete date that was in there simply has not happened. Sorry, Mark\u2014carry on.\n\nMark Thomas: Again, our concern is, at the moment, that in recent weeks, the Minister has been praising the likes of Taylor Wimpey and Bellway, but we know from on the ground that Taylor Wimpey are not engaging and communicating effectively with leaseholders in Victoria Wharf, Cardiff. And you will know that Victoria Wharf has had some three, thankfully, very minor fire incidents in the last six months or so.

Banning all sewage dumping into rivers"], "answer": "A", "content": "Y Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer: Good afternoon and welcome to today's Plenary meeting. The first item today is questions to the First Minister. Question 1, Mike Hedges.&nbsp;\n\nMike Hedges AM: 1. What action is the Welsh Government taking to reduce river pollution? OQ59418\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Mike Hedges, Dirprwy Lywydd, for that question. With ministerial colleagues, I have chaired two summits, bringing together all those bodies and organisations with a responsibility to reduce river pollution. The agreed action plan commits all participants to accelerate the practical measures that each can take to tackle pollution in our waterways\n\nMike Hedges AM: I thank the First Minister for that response. River pollution is a problem across Wales, but I only want to talk about the River Tawe. We have raw sewerage discharge, agricultural pollution and microplastics. Some suggestions: has the Welsh Government considered taking action to stop water run-off mixing with sewerage? Things I belive that could help include the planting of trees and bushes, making it a planning condition on new developments that impervious coverings are not allowed, except for a driveway with limited width, to have greater control over the use of fertiliser on farmland, and to completely ban microplastic use in commonly used materials such as cosmetics.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I thank Mike Hedges for his unfailingly constructive suggestions as to how we might tackle the scourge of river pollution. A number of the points that he has mentioned I think we have embarked upon already. As far as separating water run-off from sewerage, then the future of sustainable drainage systems, I think, is fundamental to making sure that, for all new building developments, we can relieve pressure on the network, redirecting and slowing down the speed at which surface water enters the sewer system.The Member made a number of points about agricultural pollution. Of course, we are committed to making sure that we have greater use control over fertilisers on farmland, and the sustainable farming scheme will contribute to a number of other points that Mike Hedges made. It will offer support to those farmers who choose to take it, to tree plant, particularly along river banks, but also more generally. And as for the point that the Member makes about making the planning condition on new developments, the Minister for Climate Change has undertaken to write to all local authorities, reminding them of the enforcement powers they already have in this regard. There are restrictions on paving over front gardens, for parking or any other purpose, without planning permission. And Mike Hedges is quite right to point to the fact that the way in which, increasingly in urban areas, people have turned what were previously gardens into hard standing and parking, means that there is increased run-off into sewers, adding to the risk of flooding and impacting on water quality. So, I hope the Member can see from that that a range of the suggestions that he has made are being taken forward already, and there are other ideas that he has suggested this afternoon that we will be able to explore and see if they can add to that overall cross-Government effort.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: It's clear, at the moment, that you're getting your action plan together. It is fair to say the UK Conservative Government now has a clear plan for reducing river pollution. By 2035\u2014yes, they're well ahead of the game\u2014water companies will have to improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and they will have to improve 75 per cent of overflows discharged into high-priority nature sites. By 2050, this will apply to all remaining storm overflows covered by our targets regardless of location. Wales has six out of the 20 most polluted rivers in the UK, and I am sure that you will agree that 600,000 hours of dumping into our waterways and our Welsh rivers is completely unacceptable.&nbsp;So, First Minister, would you agree with me and back the stance of the UK Conservative Government\u2014the stance they've taken to address this issue\u2014by holding water companies to account, and, if so, when are you going to do the same here in Wales?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I don't think this is an area in which there is competition between the different nations of the United Kingdom. I believe that we need to reduce river pollution in Wales, and I'm quite sure that the UK Government takes action in England to do the same thing. It is a shared ambition, particularly with rivers that cross the border, where only combined action can have the impact that we wish. Many of the things that the Member has mentioned are happening in Wales. By 2030, D\u0175r Cymru will have reduced their phosphorous pollution loading on our key areas by 90 per cent, and will have reduced it by 100 per cent by 2035. Of course, there is a great deal more that needs to be done. I agree with what the Member said that sewage dumping into rivers is not an acceptable practice, and that the industry has to invest more, and more quickly, to make sure that it tackles that. I believe that, in D\u0175r Cymru, we have a company in Wales, a not-for-profit company, that is able to invest in the Welsh infrastructure without profit taking elsewhere. I think we're fortunate to have a company structured in that way and, I think, with a genuine commitment to playing its part in reducing river pollution.\n\nJane Dodds MS: Good afternoon, First Minister. I live in Hay-on-Wye. The River Wye is the second most polluted river in Wales, after the River Usk, and the River Tawe is the third most polluted river in Wales. Many of us get our postbags filled with people writing to us about the state of our rivers. And I realise it's not a political point, but I am really disappointed that, once again, Conservative MPs voted against taking a tougher stance against sewage dumping by our water companies, something that would have helped us across the UK. I also would take issue in Wales here on D\u0175r Cymru. D\u0175r Cymru executives get paid quite a lot of money\u2014I think \u00a3600,000 was the last payment to a chief executive of D\u0175r Cymru. This is at a time when Wales's water bills are the second highest across the country. May I ask you, in terms of river sewage, First Minister, whether you would support measures to make sewage dumping illegal?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, of course the Member is right in her simple factual point about the way Conservative MPs voted on this issue. If sewage dumping were to be made illegal, then the question would arise as to what happens when storm overflows inevitably cause pressure on the system. And while I'm completely with the Member in wanting to see all of that addressed seriously and quickly, it is simply the fact that combined sewage overflows operate in a way that means that sewage doesn't come through the floors of private businesses and private homes. So, if you banned it tomorrow, you would simply displace the problem and make the problem, I think, even less acceptable to Welsh citizens. The truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that this is a complex issue, where you can only make a difference by gathering together all the different contributions from those who have a part to play. That's why our action plan has buy-in from the Welsh Government, of course, but the regulators, the developers, the farming unions, the water companies, and we will need to see it from communities themselves. In the case of the River Wye, 72 per cent of pollution in the River Wye comes from agricultural sources. So, while I agree that D\u0175r Cymru must play its part, and do it effectively, unless you're prepared to tackle the other sources of river pollution, then you won't make the difference that Jane Dodds and I would like to see.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on train services that run from Bangor along the north Wales coast railway? OQ59456\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Dirprwy Lywydd, many of the mainline services across north Wales are a UK Government responsibility, and they are delivered by Avanti West Coast. Poor performance and inadequate service levels on this essential route has placed additional pressure on regional services run by Transport for Wales and delivered an unacceptable experience for passengers across north Wales.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much. And I agree with that analysis. But, in Bangor, we have one of the busiest stations in the north of Wales, and there are plans afoot to improve the facilities there. But the most far-reaching improvement that could happen for the benefit of rail users in Arfon and beyond is electrification of the north Wales coast line. Some of the funding that is due to Wales as a result of HS2 in England would be able to be used for that electrification. But, as well as investment, we need to have the powers over rail infrastructure and bring those powers here to the Senedd. Will you make the strong case for the devolution of rail infrastructure to the Government, and make that case robustly to the UK Government, and to your own party, indeed?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those supplementaries, Dirprwy Lywydd. And I do agree that we need the full powers over railways, as well as the investment to go along with those powers. We have some powers already, and we have used those powers, as people can see, in the investment into rail lines in the Valleys and in Cardiff. If we could have full powers, then we could do a more comprehensive job of work in order to make things better here in Wales. But, to do that, the powers without the investment simply couldn't work, and that's why Si\u00e2n Gwenllian's points are important for us here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nCarolyn Thomas MS: Bangor station is already an important hub for university students and, now, with Welsh Government investing in a medical school, a dental academy and the National Slate Museum in its programme for government, Bangor station has significantly grown in importance. Do you share my disappointment to see that there will be just five services a day now between north Wales and London from May 2023, with no plans from the UK Government to restore the pre-COVID level of service? By awarding a six-month contract to Avanti, they are delaying a much needed reconsideration of the service provided, and such a short-term offer will not incentivise Avanti to improve the service or resolve any other outstanding issues. So, I am just concerned that this is another kick in the teeth for the people of north Wales and for trying to grow the economy there, and to get people to Bangor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Dirpwy Lywydd, I thank Carolyn Thomas for that. She makes a very important point. The decision of Avanti West Coast to reduce services between north Wales and London was made without any prior notification to the Welsh Government or to Transport for Wales, despite the very obvious knock-on effect onto those local train services. Not only did it arbitrarily reduce those services, but, clearly, that was good enough for the UK Government, because, despite that, they've gone ahead and awarded a six-month contract extension to Avanti West Coast. Now, I am told that Avanti is committed to improving that service. I am glad to see that the new chief executive of Avanti West Coast has offered a meeting with our transport Minister to set out the actions they are taking, but the truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that the problems on the railway are more basic than any single franchise. The way in which rail services are designed and delivered across the United Kingdom simply does not meet the needs of the travelling public. In order to have a more fundamental review, you need what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian said in her original question\u2014you need the powers transferred to Wales and the investment to go alongside it, and then, in the way that we have taken those parts of the railway that are under our control back under public control, we will be able to do that and make a much better job of rail services in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nSam Rowlands MS: My colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian is absolutely right to raise concerns again about the train services in north Wales. And I must say, First Minister, you have a refreshingly honest Deputy Minister for transport who clearly has concerns about the state of the Labour-run rail service here in Wales as well. He was recently quoted as saying that Transport for Wales could be 'awful' and has been 'pretty bleak for a while'. Do you agree with him, First Minister?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: What I agree was the point that the Minister was actually making, because he was pointing to the decision of the UK Government to set out a future for rail services in Wales that can only be one of managed decline. That is the policy of your party and the Government that you support. That is why they have agreed the next period of investment for Network Rail that has Wales at the very foot of the league table. Every other region but one has better investment over the next period than is going to be offered in Wales, despite the fact that investment in the Welsh rail service has been dismal over the whole 13 years in which your Government has been in charge. That was the point the Deputy Minister was making, and it\u2019s one I think any person who takes an objective look at the facts of rail investment in Wales would endorse.\n\nY Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer: We move on now to questions from party leaders, and, first of all, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. Last week, First Minister, the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru issued a damning statement, in fairness, assessing the engagement so far the Welsh Government has had with the UK-wide COVID inquiry. Now, from these benches, we have time and time again said that there should be a Wales-wide independent inquiry; regrettably, the Labour benches have voted that proposal down, so we do rely on, obviously, the Welsh Government engaging with the UK inquiry to make sure that all the facts are presented and can be understood by that inquiry. Can you give us an update on how the Welsh Government is engaging with the COVID inquiry at a UK level? And are you as concerned as I am with the judgment that the COVID bereaved families have around non-disclosure and the timeliness of the evidence that the Welsh Government is submitting to the inquiry?\n\n"}

The public health approach to preventing gender-based violence in Wales is in its early stages.", "D. Lara Snowdon thinks the Welsh Government has successfully embedded the public health approach."], "answer": "C", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: This is our first evidence session on our inquiry into the public health approach to preventing gender-based violence, and I'm very pleased to welcome Lara Snowdon, the public health lead in the violence prevention unit within Public Health Wales. So, thank you very much, Lara, for joining us. We've got your paper, so we've all read it. I wonder if you could set out what the Welsh Government has done, in its vision and frameworks, to support implementation of a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence.\n\nLara Snowdon: Prynhawn da, Chair. Chair, sorry, would you mind repeating the question? I had a technical issue at the start. Your voice was duplicated. Apologies.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Don't worry. Obviously, there's a new policy action by the Welsh Government on gender-based violence, and, obviously, you're arguing very strongly for a public health approach. Could you tell us how the Welsh Government has approached the vision and the frameworks to ensure that we are implementing a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence?\n\nLara Snowdon: Thank you, Chair. We really welcome the inclusion of a public health approach in the violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy. I think it will be really key to achieving the goal in the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Act 2015 of ensuring that the Welsh Government implements preventative practice to prevent VAWDASV. However, I think it's fair to say that, at the moment, the approach in Wales is very much in its infancy. So, we have this high-level commitment in the strategy, but there is still a lot of work, really, to do to embed that approach in practice across Wales.We have the blueprint approach as well, which is one of the commitments of the new VAWDASV strategy, and I think that will be really key in terms of developing multi-agency practice for VAWDASV prevention, which is a key part of a public health approach. It's also a tried-and-tested model that has been used for youth justice and women's justice in Wales, and, I think, particularly to navigate the complexities of the devolved and non-devolved landscape as well. So, I think we have this high-level commitment, I think there's a recognition that we should be taking a public health approach, and particularly focusing on prevention, which is really important, and I welcome the focus of the inquiry on it today, but we still have quite a long way to go in terms of actually developing what that looks like in practice.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, when you talk about a blueprint approach, you're meaning a collaborative approach, are you?\n\nLara Snowdon: Yes, that's right. So, one of the commitments in the strategy was to take a blueprint approach, which is an approach that has been developed in Wales, particularly with youth justice and women's justice, and it's really a multi-agency action plan. So, it takes that systematic approach that we look for in a public health approach.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. So, how well are public and private sector organisations engaging with understanding this public health approach?\n\nLara Snowdon: As I said, it's really an approach that I think is in its infancy in Wales. So, there is this commitment. I think there's a real drive by a range, particularly, of public sector agencies to understand what this is and to implement it, but there's still a long way to go, I think, in terms of implementing it fully.I wanted to mention as well the serious violence duty. So, this is another legislative driver that we have at the moment to implement a public health approach. The serious violence duty is an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. So, it's central Government legislation, but it puts a responsibility on a range of multi-agency partners to take a public health approach to violence prevention. So, I wanted to mention that, because we have these two drivers, really, for taking a public health approach. They're both relatively new. So, with the serious violence duty, they tend to be regional multi-agency partnerships, which are being set up across Wales, to implement a public health approach. There are two statutory responsibilities: one is to do a strategic needs assessment, and one is to do a strategy. So, I think what will be quite important going forward will be to ensure that, with the commitments of the VAWDASV Act and the commitments of the serious violence duty, we ensure that partners can work together across both of those duties, to ensure there isn't duplication or siloed working, really. So, as I said, quite a long way to go to implement it fully, but we certainly now have some of the drivers to ensure that it can be put into place.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Just very briefly, what's the difference between the serious violence duty and the 'ask and act' that we talk about, colloquially?\n\nLara Snowdon: So, 'ask and act' is particularly a duty on health service professionals to be aware of what VAWDASV is and to understand that they have a role in actively asking the question about the experience of VAWDASV, and then taking responsible and appropriate action if they discover that somebody has experienced VAWDASV. The serious violence duty is a piece of legislation that is on organisations to collaborate to take a public health preventative approach to what's termed as serious violence\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, you're saying that 'ask and act' only applies to the health service, not to the education service, the housing service, or anything else?\n\nLara Snowdon: Sorry, it's because I'm from public health, so particularly in my sphere of work we're working to ensure that it's implemented across health, but there's a wider multi-agency responsibility on 'ask and act'.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Just to put some slightly counter views to you: Dr Burrell, of Durham University, supports the public health approach, but says that the gendered roots of violence against women and girls must remain front and centre. Is that something you agree with, or do you think that we need to change the emphasis?\n\nLara Snowdon: No, I absolutely agree with Dr Burrell, and very much respect Dr Burrell, particularly in his role in engaging men and boys in the prevention of gender-based violence. In terms of gender-based violence, really, the clue is in the title\u2014it's where gender is recognised as a causal factor in what causes that violence to take place. So, we can understand gender as a causal factor, but then intersect it by other risk and protective factors, which may increase or decrease the risk of VAWDASV taking place. So, we quite often would describe gender as a cause and a consequence\u2014. Sorry, we would quite often understand gender-based violence as a cause and a consequence of gender inequality. So, gender inequality underpins gender-based violence, but it also reproduces it as well. It's really important to understand this, because this tells us a lot about what the preventative measures are.So, again, through a public health approach, we would talk about modifiable risk factors; so, these are factors that can be changed, which is the key part of how preventative programmes are developed. We know that people of the male sex are more likely to perpetrate violence, as well as gender-based violence, but we also know that particular kinds of social norms are harmful\u2014so, those that are rooted in patriarchal norms, misogyny, sexism\u2014and we know that those social norms can lead to violence. So, through the VAWDASV literature review, we really found that programmes that sought to transform those harmful gender norms, and to work alongside men and boys, to really critically think about what those social norms look like, and then how they can engage in them, to change them among their peer group, really, is a really important thing that we can do for the prevention of gender-based violence.I think the only other thing really to say on this is around intersectionality. So, whilst we have to remember that gender is front and centre, gender is intersected by other intersections, I guess, of social categories. So, that could be something like socioeconomic deprivation, or race, or sexuality, or religion, and some of these things can make women and girls, in particular, more at risk of experiencing gender-based violence. It could also change the nature of the violence that is experienced as well as the response that they get from the services that they try to access. So, sorry, a slightly long answer there, but we can certainly understand gender as a causal risk factor, which is intersected by other factors as well.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. I agree that this is not <em>Daily Mail</em> stuff. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Just finally from me, could you tell me how well you think the VAWDASV strategy understands the complexity of reaching different diverse communities, such as those you've outlined, so that we're confident that it's going to reach all women and girls, and indeed, men and boys?\n\nLara Snowdon: Again, I think, really, I have the same answer in the sense that it's fantastic that intersectionality is recognised in the VAWDASV strategy, but again, I think there is a long way to go to ensure that the diversity that we have in communities in Wales is represented in VAWDASV prevention and response. So, some examples that we know of research that has been conducted in Wales, such as the 'Uncharted Territory Review', which explored the experiences of women and girls who are migrants, asylum seekers or refugees, wasn't included in the VAWDASV strategy, for example. So, we know that there's a lot of research going on, we know that there's a lot more to do, but having, as a principle, intersectionality, and particularly understanding how prevention programming can intersect with the needs of diverse communities, is going to be really important going forward.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. I'll now ask Sarah Murphy to come in.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much for being here with us this morning. I'm going to ask some questions now about evidence and data. Public Health Wales's systematic review of what works in preventing VAWDASV was published in September 2021. The national advisers for VAWDASV say that the Public Health Wales review has not yet been included in the Welsh Government's VAWDASV strategy. Do you know what the reasons for this are, please?\n\nLara Snowdon: Unfortunately, I don't think I can answer your question directly, because that would be a question for Welsh Government. I do\u2014\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Okay. If I phrase it differently then: do you think that there is sufficient transparency and accountability in the delivery of the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint?\n\nLara Snowdon: Yes. Again, really, this is in the very early stages of implementation; the governance around the blueprint has only recently been established. So, I think we will be looking to see, over the next year or so, how this is implemented. The high-level work plans for the blueprint are now just being published, I believe. I've had assurance that prevention has been included, but I haven't yet seen the detail of that, unfortunately. So, unfortunately, I think it's a bit too early to be really looking at that, but I want to say to Welsh Government colleagues, 'Please do reach out and talk to us about how we can ensure that the blueprint plans are as evidence-based and as theory-based as possible.' We do have this fantastic resource of the VAWDASV systematic review that we can draw upon; there's a lot of evidence in there about what works. Where there are gaps, we need to really understand how we can take a co-ordinated response to research and evaluation for gender-based violence prevention. So, I'm really looking forward to working with colleagues on taking that forward.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much. Can I ask why the systematic review covered primary and secondary interventions, but not tertiary prevention? And, what are the benefits of developing multi-agency data on gender-based violence to measure the prevalence and trends and to monitor inequalities and track progress in prevention? How feasible do you think it is for it to be able to cover all of this?\n\nLara Snowdon: To answer the first part of your question, we focused on primary and secondary prevention because, really, they are areas of both research and practice that are generally under-represented, so I really welcome the committee focusing on this as part of the inquiry. There is really a wealth of evidence around tertiary prevention in comparison to primary and secondary prevention, which is why we decided to focus on this.&nbsp;In addition, it would be absolutely huge if you focused on all three areas. So, that was the reason to focus on that, as well as to meet the commitments in the VAWDASV Act around prevention.&nbsp;On the second part of your question, around data, I think this answers your former question as well, in a sense, because one of the commitments of the VAWDASV Act is to develop a set of national indicators to measure progress around VAWDASV prevention. That is going to be the kind of key thing that we can do to understand whether the strategy and whether the blueprint approach are being effective, essentially. I know that some work has started on the national indicators, but, again, I think this is going to be really critical to ensure that we're understanding that population-level change towards VAWDASV prevention. It really needs to be underpinned by a robust theory of change that is based on evidence and based on a principle to evaluate all of the blueprint activity to ensure that the indicators match the theory of change. So, I think that will be really key to holding partners to account, but also to ensuring that overall governance, really, for the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you. My last question, then, and you've already touched on this a bit. We've heard that the current 'ask and act' duty doesn't empower professionals to act, often because they are unsure about how to handle a disclosure and the responsibility that they will have as individuals for managing the risk. Do you have details of any reviews into how effectively legislative duties such as the 'ask and act' duty are being delivered, please?\n\n"}

Can I invite firstly Mr Ieuan Evans to introduce himself for the record?\n\nIeuan Evans: Ieuan Evans, chair, Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you very much.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: And, Mr Nigel Walker.\n\nNigel Walker: Nigel Walker, acting chief executive officer of the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you so much. On behalf of Members, I really would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to give evidence today. It's a really important issue; it's something that has the interest of Members of the Senedd, members of the public, and obviously the press and the wider public in Wales. This is something that has come out following the <em>BBC Wales Investigates </em>programme on 23 January. Would you like to make a short opening statement?\n\nIeuan Evans: Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the invitation to appear before the committee this morning. We're very pleased to have the opportunity, and we are aware, as the stewards of Welsh rugby, that we have a great responsibility, and we're aware that we've disappointed the rugby family across Wales. The experience has been sobering for us, but as the new chair, I am determined to make the changes that are necessary to improve rugby in Wales. You will be aware of some of the changes that we have already announced. Also, Nigel has taken the role of acting chief executive.\n\nIeuan Evans: We fully understand and embrace the WRU's unique role in the sporting, economic and civic life in Wales, embedded in its social fabric, and how we project ourselves is critical. We need to get this right; we need to take advice and seek input from others, so we've been working closely with Welsh Government and Sport Wales, and of course, talking to our staff, our players, our member clubs and our commercial partners about the next steps. We are a \u00a3100 million-turnover business, and that includes some public funding. We take our responsibility for spending public funds extremely seriously. We have 80,000 players across 300 clubs, and many more thousands of young people in schools across Wales playing rugby. We're a showcase for Wales to the world. We have a duty, and a responsibility to be as good as we can be, and it's my job to make that happen.Hopefully, today, we can outline for you the changes we have already put in place and answer some of the questions that I'm sure you have. As you know, we will be working with our partners to establish a taskforce with external expertise to help us achieve the cultural change we need, and we'll have more information about that this morning as we finalise some of those details, as they're not all in place as yet. And we've agreed, of course, that Sport Wales will be identifying an independent chair and we will be working with them and the membership in terms of reference for that review, and I'm sure that we can elaborate on that as the hearing goes on. We're happy therefore to provide more details to the committee when those arrangements are finalised.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. So, we'll move on to questions. Why do you think the WRU is in this situation?\n\nIeuan Evans: As a relatively new chair\u2014a matter of weeks\u2014I've been humbled and harrowed by what I've heard, particularly the impact on our female staff and players. I think we all know that we should do more, we need to do more to make the game and our organisation more inclusive, but I was shocked by the personal stories highlighted by our former staff in the programme, and I can only apologise once more to them, and not only them but people elsewhere affected by the allegations in that programme as well, and to say that I will work night and day to ensure that all of our staff feel safe and valued.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. I'll bring Alun Davies in in a moment, but could I just press you on that, because your words are obviously heartfelt, and I appreciate that, but in terms of why you think this has happened, what would be your analysis of that?\n\nNigel Walker: I'm happy to come in there. I think, in any organisation, especially a large organisation like the Welsh Rugby Union, it's possible for things to occur over a period of time and for people to turn a blind eye, and not to address those problems, and then it's not until, sometimes, an organisation is forced to face the reality of the position they find themselves in that they begin to really look deeply and look back to the past and begin to join the dots. So, the warning signs have been there for quite some time. When it's presented as graphically as it was during the BBC Wales programme the week before last, it hits you like a 10-tonne truck.I should offer my apologies. My thoughts are with those members of staff, those players and ex-players who have had an experience that no individual should have. The key now is, yes, we're apologetic, yes, we've made statements, yes, we've accepted that we've got a problem; the key now is to begin to understand the scale and scope of that problem, to seek outside help, which Ieuan has referred to, and to give an undertaking that, when those recommendations come through, whether it's in three months, six months, whenever they come through, we will do everything in our power to implement them, to make sure that the experiences that those women, players, young girls, maybe, have experienced, won't be repeated in the future, or at least you minimise the prospect of those things happening again.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. When you say the very graphic nature of some of these reports that have come out, could you tell us why it took that happening for action to be taken, rather than it happening when these reports had first been made clear to you?\n\nNigel Walker: To be candid, I think, as an organisation, we have been in denial as to the extent of the problem. So, there have been cases in the past that have been dealt with\u2014in theory, dealt with, and people have moved on. I think each individual case is an indication that there has been a wider problem, but people have not joined the dots. When you see it presented over a 30-minute programme in the way that it was, unless you're going to bury your head in the sand for another six months or 12 months, you have to take action, and that's the position we're in. None of us are proud of the position we're in.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. I'm going to bring in Alun.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Thanks very much. Can I challenge you a little bit on your assertion, Mr Evans, that you were shocked by what you've learned? I was reading parts of your autobiography that were scathing about the WRU in different ways. You said that there were people on the WRU who were simply not capable of taking the right decisions because they were too parochial, too insular or just plain short-sighted.&nbsp;You went on to ask how you could have officials from small clubs with no real knowledge of world rugby making decisions that affected the national team, and more often than not affected it for the worse.&nbsp;And you also said, 'At a time when our rivals were planning ahead and learning from the likes of Australia and New Zealand, too many of our people seemed more concerned with ensuring that they had their supply of free tickets and hotel accommodation for international weekend junkets'.Now, that's harsher, in many ways, than anything we've heard in the last week, and that was written some years ago. So, you were clearly aware that there were significant and deep-rooted problems with the WRU, so what you've heard this last week couldn't have shocked you.\n\nIeuan Evans: One of the reasons I came on to the board\u2014and I have been chair for, as I said, a matter of weeks\u2014I've been quite open and candid in my desire to ensure that our organisation is a high-functioning organisation, to drive us to new horizons, and we need to be reflective. My desire\u2014and you've read the press release that went out last night with regard to it\u2014and, as a board, our desire is to convince and compel our member clubs, as we are a union of member clubs and the constitution dictates that clubs need to vote through changes before they can be implemented, that we need to be a diverse, skill set-based board, with an independent chair. I've actively campaigned to find my replacement; we need to have an independent chair. I'm conscious, for us to deliver on our strategic objectives, that we need a board composition overhaul, and it's how we achieve that. We were quite open in the press statement with regard to what we intend to put to the clubs in an extraordinary general meeting at the end of March or earlier. That is our aim, because that's how the organisation needs to be run. Yes, we have a main board, we also have a community game board, which runs the community game with elected representatives from the clubs, and I wish to broaden that and make it a broader church to be truly representative of our game.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I don't disagree with that, but my question was\u2014I think the statement last night was very positive, by the way, I've got no issue about that\u2014my question was about your knowledge about what was happening. You're both giants of our game. You must have had an awareness of what was happening. Your words, Ieuan, were absolutely brutal about the WRU.\n\nNigel Walker: Can I\u2014? Not that Ieuan needs me to defend him, but the words that you've\u2014and I haven't read Ieuan's autobiography, by the way.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Well, you should, it's very illustrative.\n\nNigel Walker: I'm sure that those words were talking in general terms about the running of the organisation. It was the graphic nature of the sexism and misogyny in last week's programme that was the bit that was particularly distressing, talking from my point of view, and I know that Ieuan shares that point of view.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: There was a review in 2021 into the women's game, could you tell us how the WRU responded to that and would you commit to making those findings public?\n\nNigel Walker: I went through and interview process in May/June 2021. At the latter stages of that process, certain elements of that review were presented to me and it became one of the interview questions: 'What would you do?' I was appointed in July and started in September. When I read the review, I was shocked as to the extent of the problem. There are 40 recommendations in the review, and it was obvious that the Welsh Rugby Union had failed women's rugby. You'll find, during the course of the next 40 minutes, I'm just going to be completely honest with you\u2014\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: We appreciate your honesty.\n\nNigel Walker: So, one of my first tasks was to try to address the problems that were present in the women's game. I remember, even before I took up my appointment formally at the end of September, I addressed the women's squad. They were at the NCE, the national centre of excellence, in Hensol, they were all sitting in front of me, and I apologised. Steve Phillips, the CEO, was next to me. I apologised for what they had been through in the recent past and I said that I was here to make changes and that I would be actively pursuing the prospect of a world class programme for our women players. I said that I would have professional contracts in their hands by the end of December. When I said that, at least half a dozen of them looked up at the ceiling\u2014and I've related this story to them\u2014because they'd heard it all before. But, by December 2021, they had professional contracts. We have made enormous progress against the 40 recommendations. I think the recommendations of that review have been circulated. I'm happy to answer any questions, I can talk about the progress that we've made, and I can talk about the areas that are still to be corrected. But, probably 32 or 33 of those recommendations have been implemented in full\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. And the report, it will be published.\n\n"}

The first item today is questions to the First Minister. Question 1, Mike Hedges.&nbsp;\n\nMike Hedges AM: 1. What action is the Welsh Government taking to reduce river pollution? OQ59418\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Mike Hedges, Dirprwy Lywydd, for that question. With ministerial colleagues, I have chaired two summits, bringing together all those bodies and organisations with a responsibility to reduce river pollution. The agreed action plan commits all participants to accelerate the practical measures that each can take to tackle pollution in our waterways\n\nMike Hedges AM: I thank the First Minister for that response. River pollution is a problem across Wales, but I only want to talk about the River Tawe. We have raw sewerage discharge, agricultural pollution and microplastics. Some suggestions: has the Welsh Government considered taking action to stop water run-off mixing with sewerage? Things I belive that could help include the planting of trees and bushes, making it a planning condition on new developments that impervious coverings are not allowed, except for a driveway with limited width, to have greater control over the use of fertiliser on farmland, and to completely ban microplastic use in commonly used materials such as cosmetics.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I thank Mike Hedges for his unfailingly constructive suggestions as to how we might tackle the scourge of river pollution. A number of the points that he has mentioned I think we have embarked upon already. As far as separating water run-off from sewerage, then the future of sustainable drainage systems, I think, is fundamental to making sure that, for all new building developments, we can relieve pressure on the network, redirecting and slowing down the speed at which surface water enters the sewer system.The Member made a number of points about agricultural pollution. Of course, we are committed to making sure that we have greater use control over fertilisers on farmland, and the sustainable farming scheme will contribute to a number of other points that Mike Hedges made. It will offer support to those farmers who choose to take it, to tree plant, particularly along river banks, but also more generally. And as for the point that the Member makes about making the planning condition on new developments, the Minister for Climate Change has undertaken to write to all local authorities, reminding them of the enforcement powers they already have in this regard. There are restrictions on paving over front gardens, for parking or any other purpose, without planning permission. And Mike Hedges is quite right to point to the fact that the way in which, increasingly in urban areas, people have turned what were previously gardens into hard standing and parking, means that there is increased run-off into sewers, adding to the risk of flooding and impacting on water quality. So, I hope the Member can see from that that a range of the suggestions that he has made are being taken forward already, and there are other ideas that he has suggested this afternoon that we will be able to explore and see if they can add to that overall cross-Government effort.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: It's clear, at the moment, that you're getting your action plan together. It is fair to say the UK Conservative Government now has a clear plan for reducing river pollution. By 2035\u2014yes, they're well ahead of the game\u2014water companies will have to improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and they will have to improve 75 per cent of overflows discharged into high-priority nature sites. By 2050, this will apply to all remaining storm overflows covered by our targets regardless of location. Wales has six out of the 20 most polluted rivers in the UK, and I am sure that you will agree that 600,000 hours of dumping into our waterways and our Welsh rivers is completely unacceptable.&nbsp;So, First Minister, would you agree with me and back the stance of the UK Conservative Government\u2014the stance they've taken to address this issue\u2014by holding water companies to account, and, if so, when are you going to do the same here in Wales?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I don't think this is an area in which there is competition between the different nations of the United Kingdom. I believe that we need to reduce river pollution in Wales, and I'm quite sure that the UK Government takes action in England to do the same thing. It is a shared ambition, particularly with rivers that cross the border, where only combined action can have the impact that we wish. Many of the things that the Member has mentioned are happening in Wales. By 2030, D\u0175r Cymru will have reduced their phosphorous pollution loading on our key areas by 90 per cent, and will have reduced it by 100 per cent by 2035. Of course, there is a great deal more that needs to be done. I agree with what the Member said that sewage dumping into rivers is not an acceptable practice, and that the industry has to invest more, and more quickly, to make sure that it tackles that. I believe that, in D\u0175r Cymru, we have a company in Wales, a not-for-profit company, that is able to invest in the Welsh infrastructure without profit taking elsewhere. I think we're fortunate to have a company structured in that way and, I think, with a genuine commitment to playing its part in reducing river pollution.\n\nJane Dodds MS: Good afternoon, First Minister. I live in Hay-on-Wye. The River Wye is the second most polluted river in Wales, after the River Usk, and the River Tawe is the third most polluted river in Wales. Many of us get our postbags filled with people writing to us about the state of our rivers. And I realise it's not a political point, but I am really disappointed that, once again, Conservative MPs voted against taking a tougher stance against sewage dumping by our water companies, something that would have helped us across the UK. I also would take issue in Wales here on D\u0175r Cymru. D\u0175r Cymru executives get paid quite a lot of money\u2014I think \u00a3600,000 was the last payment to a chief executive of D\u0175r Cymru. This is at a time when Wales's water bills are the second highest across the country. May I ask you, in terms of river sewage, First Minister, whether you would support measures to make sewage dumping illegal?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, of course the Member is right in her simple factual point about the way Conservative MPs voted on this issue. If sewage dumping were to be made illegal, then the question would arise as to what happens when storm overflows inevitably cause pressure on the system. And while I'm completely with the Member in wanting to see all of that addressed seriously and quickly, it is simply the fact that combined sewage overflows operate in a way that means that sewage doesn't come through the floors of private businesses and private homes. So, if you banned it tomorrow, you would simply displace the problem and make the problem, I think, even less acceptable to Welsh citizens. The truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that this is a complex issue, where you can only make a difference by gathering together all the different contributions from those who have a part to play. That's why our action plan has buy-in from the Welsh Government, of course, but the regulators, the developers, the farming unions, the water companies, and we will need to see it from communities themselves. In the case of the River Wye, 72 per cent of pollution in the River Wye comes from agricultural sources. So, while I agree that D\u0175r Cymru must play its part, and do it effectively, unless you're prepared to tackle the other sources of river pollution, then you won't make the difference that Jane Dodds and I would like to see.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on train services that run from Bangor along the north Wales coast railway? OQ59456\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Dirprwy Lywydd, many of the mainline services across north Wales are a UK Government responsibility, and they are delivered by Avanti West Coast. Poor performance and inadequate service levels on this essential route has placed additional pressure on regional services run by Transport for Wales and delivered an unacceptable experience for passengers across north Wales.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much. And I agree with that analysis. But, in Bangor, we have one of the busiest stations in the north of Wales, and there are plans afoot to improve the facilities there. But the most far-reaching improvement that could happen for the benefit of rail users in Arfon and beyond is electrification of the north Wales coast line. Some of the funding that is due to Wales as a result of HS2 in England would be able to be used for that electrification. But, as well as investment, we need to have the powers over rail infrastructure and bring those powers here to the Senedd. Will you make the strong case for the devolution of rail infrastructure to the Government, and make that case robustly to the UK Government, and to your own party, indeed?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those supplementaries, Dirprwy Lywydd. And I do agree that we need the full powers over railways, as well as the investment to go along with those powers. We have some powers already, and we have used those powers, as people can see, in the investment into rail lines in the Valleys and in Cardiff. If we could have full powers, then we could do a more comprehensive job of work in order to make things better here in Wales. But, to do that, the powers without the investment simply couldn't work, and that's why Si\u00e2n Gwenllian's points are important for us here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nCarolyn Thomas MS: Bangor station is already an important hub for university students and, now, with Welsh Government investing in a medical school, a dental academy and the National Slate Museum in its programme for government, Bangor station has significantly grown in importance. Do you share my disappointment to see that there will be just five services a day now between north Wales and London from May 2023, with no plans from the UK Government to restore the pre-COVID level of service? By awarding a six-month contract to Avanti, they are delaying a much needed reconsideration of the service provided, and such a short-term offer will not incentivise Avanti to improve the service or resolve any other outstanding issues. So, I am just concerned that this is another kick in the teeth for the people of north Wales and for trying to grow the economy there, and to get people to Bangor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Dirpwy Lywydd, I thank Carolyn Thomas for that. She makes a very important point. The decision of Avanti West Coast to reduce services between north Wales and London was made without any prior notification to the Welsh Government or to Transport for Wales, despite the very obvious knock-on effect onto those local train services. Not only did it arbitrarily reduce those services, but, clearly, that was good enough for the UK Government, because, despite that, they've gone ahead and awarded a six-month contract extension to Avanti West Coast. Now, I am told that Avanti is committed to improving that service. I am glad to see that the new chief executive of Avanti West Coast has offered a meeting with our transport Minister to set out the actions they are taking, but the truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that the problems on the railway are more basic than any single franchise. The way in which rail services are designed and delivered across the United Kingdom simply does not meet the needs of the travelling public. In order to have a more fundamental review, you need what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian said in her original question\u2014you need the powers transferred to Wales and the investment to go alongside it, and then, in the way that we have taken those parts of the railway that are under our control back under public control, we will be able to do that and make a much better job of rail services in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nSam Rowlands MS: My colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian is absolutely right to raise concerns again about the train services in north Wales. And I must say, First Minister, you have a refreshingly honest Deputy Minister for transport who clearly has concerns about the state of the Labour-run rail service here in Wales as well. He was recently quoted as saying that Transport for Wales could be 'awful' and has been 'pretty bleak for a while'. Do you agree with him, First Minister?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: What I agree was the point that the Minister was actually making, because he was pointing to the decision of the UK Government to set out a future for rail services in Wales that can only be one of managed decline. That is the policy of your party and the Government that you support. That is why they have agreed the next period of investment for Network Rail that has Wales at the very foot of the league table. Every other region but one has better investment over the next period than is going to be offered in Wales, despite the fact that investment in the Welsh rail service has been dismal over the whole 13 years in which your Government has been in charge. That was the point the Deputy Minister was making, and it\u2019s one I think any person who takes an objective look at the facts of rail investment in Wales would endorse.\n\nY Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer: We move on now to questions from party leaders, and, first of all, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. Last week, First Minister, the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru issued a damning statement, in fairness, assessing the engagement so far the Welsh Government has had with the UK-wide COVID inquiry. Now, from these benches, we have time and time again said that there should be a Wales-wide independent inquiry; regrettably, the Labour benches have voted that proposal down, so we do rely on, obviously, the Welsh Government engaging with the UK inquiry to make sure that all the facts are presented and can be understood by that inquiry. Can you give us an update on how the Welsh Government is engaging with the COVID inquiry at a UK level? And are you as concerned as I am with the judgment that the COVID bereaved families have around non-disclosure and the timeliness of the evidence that the Welsh Government is submitting to the inquiry?\n\n"}

The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the Minister for Social Justice, and the first question is from Russell George.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: 1. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Health and Social Services about ensuring equal access to public toilets for disabled people? OQ59514\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you for your question. I have set up the disability rights taskforce to advance disability rights in Wales. I engaged with all ministerial colleagues to determine the action that needs to be taken in each portfolio area, including access to public toilets for disabled people.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you for your answer, Minister. According to the Great British Public Toilet Map, there are 25 public toilets in Montgomeryshire, in my constituency, but only seven of those are available to those with disabilities. This is really concerning, particularly as there are a lot of people across the county who do have disabilities and need to use a public toilet more than most for various reasons, and they need to have confidence that when they go to a public toilet that there are going to be appropriate facilities for them, not to mention, of course, that Montgomeryshire is a tourism hotspot, at least it is at the moment. And I hope, Minister, you also recognise how important it is in attracting holidaymakers who will also have disabilities. I'm thinking particularly of a project in my constituency. Berriew Community Council, just off the trunk road, are very keen to bring forward facilities for those with disabilities also. But, I wonder what advice you can give in terms of what the Welsh Government can support, because so far they're having real difficulty in attracting the appropriate funds in order to update the facilities.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Russell George. A really important question. We know that a lack of accessible local toilets can limit disabled people's lives, stopping them going out, leading to isolation, anxiety, health conditions, and those are the factors that we need to address. In fact, the Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination not only in the workplace, but in wider society, and we need to promote and deliver on our ambitions to give equal rights and dignity to disabled people in Wales. Now, we have got public toilets provision, and the provision of changing places is moving forward, because\u2014they're not in my portfolio\u2014changes have been made to the building regulations regarding the provision of changing places specifically focused for disabled people. These changes came into force on 3 January.I think your community council would be well advised to engage with the local authority\u2014Powys County Council in this respect\u2014because we also have, under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017, a requirement for each local authority in Wales to produce a local toilet strategy for its area, in consultation with residents and other delivery partners, which would be your community council. It's important, actually, that that Act's provisions are designed to improve toilet provision for everyone and to recognise that, as part of their local toilet strategies, local authorities are required to assess the needs of their communities, including those of disabled people and their carers, and to take steps through the strategy to meet those needs.\n\nJane Dodds MS: 2. Will the Minister provide an update on the learning to date from the care leavers basic income pilot? OQ59510\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much for your question. A comprehensive and detailed resarch strategy is in place to evaluate the basic income pilot, led by Cardiff University, but it is too early to provide data on the impact of the programme. We anticipate being able to publish further monitoring data on the basic income pilot in the autumn.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Thank you so much, Minister. It's pleasing to hear the promising early feedback surrounding the basic income pilot for care leavers, especially comments from you noting that we're already beginning to see the benefits of the scheme. I remember, as well, the motion that I tabled last year, back in July, which called on the Welsh Government to consider how a basic income pilot could be extended to include workers employed in heavy industry\u2014the transition basic income pilot. We've got a legal challenge with Aberpergwm mine ongoing and the announcement this year that Liberty Steel would be letting go of 150 workers from its Newport and Torfaen sites. Therefore, there is a dire need to provide workers with stability and security as these industries change. And the Government is expected to look at their just transition framework for a net-zero Wales in the future. We need to take communities with us and to provide the support that they need. So, could I ask you what conversations you've had, perhaps, across with Ministers for climate change and economy as part of creating a just transition framework on expanding the basic income pilot, following its current iteration, to support workers to transition to green jobs? Diolch.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch, Jane Dodds. And I'd like to thank you for your consistent support for the basic income pilot for our care leavers, with the support you've given since the day we announced it here in the Senedd. I just want to say that the Deputy Minister for Social Services, Julie Morgan, and I met with care leavers at the end of October to discuss the pilot and their experience of it, and learning from them is going to feed into the evaluation. I'm pleased that, of the young people who were eligible in the first six months of the pilot, 92 per cent signed up and were already receiving their monthly payment. And it is important that we link this to your debate and the questions that you've also asked, about updates on this work.In terms of the just transition, you'll be aware, of course, that the Minister for Climate Change took a call for evidence on just transition between last year and 15 March. There has been a good response to that and they're being analysed, so that will come through. And I think what's important to recognise is that the policy drive for our basic income pilot is to support care leavers to make that positive transition from local authority care, using basic income as a means. And, as I've said before, basic income is the mechanism for this, rather than the purpose of the programme, to give care leavers a real chance and opportunity in life. So, I know that we will be able to look at not just the evaluation of the basic income pilot in terms of that use of that mechanism and the impact it has on care leavers, but also how you could look at it in terms, clearly, of the just transition and opportunities there, when we hear from that call for evidence.\n\nJoel James MS: As you will know, Minister, research has continually shown that those who have gone through foster, residential or kinship care are more likely to become parents at a far younger age than others. Indeed, studies in the UK have shown that almost a quarter of young care leavers have children at the point of leaving care, and this proportion increases to almost 50 per cent around two years later, with evidence showing the reasons behind this being the conscious and unconscious seeking of unmet relational and familial needs. I'm extremely supportive that more needs to be done to help those who have gone through the care system, but I still question whether or not a UBI trial is the right way, especially as it has a cliff-edge end to it when the monthly income of \u00a31,600 comes to an end after two years. With this in mind, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the impact that this trial will have on young care-experienced parents and their children when their extra income ends, because I'm genuinely concerned about the negative ramifications that can happen when people who have adjusted their spending patterns and lifestyle to accommodate extra income suddenly find themselves without it? Thank you.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much, Joel James, for that question. I know you will anticipate and, I'm sure, be very interested in the interim results from this Cascade\u2014the Cardiff University Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre\u2014independent evaluation. And this is about seeking to understand the impact of the pilot on the lives of care leavers, and, as you know, it runs until 2026, very much engaging with the views and experiences of young people involved in the pilot. And, of course, we have much engagement support around those young people\u2014local authority stakeholders, Voices from Care Cymru, Citizens Advice partners\u2014helping and supporting our young people in terms of overcoming challenges. But also, just from our experience of meeting with the young people, the scope of their ambition, their interest, their determination for their lives to progress as a result of this opportunity they've been given sets them in very good stead for their future\u2014their whole adult life, I'd say. This is about actually seeing if their whole adult life ahead of them could be transformed by this trust and funding and financial support that we're giving to these young people. Yes, of course, already some of those care-experienced young people who are on the pilot will be in this situation\u2014there will be young parents\u2014and they will move on, as all young people do, into adult life. But I think that's a very useful observation in terms of looking at their experience.Can I just say that 50 per cent of young people enrolled have responded to the Your Life Beyond Care survey? That's a really important survey. Obviously, the Deputy Minister for Social Services is responsible for care leavers and care-experienced young people, and I'm delighted that the First Minister launched, with a number of Ministers, the declaration that came from care-experienced young people. And I do urge the Member, and all Members, to look at that declaration, because that declaration came from work that they did themselves\u2014young people\u2014to tell us in Government how they felt we could do better, at local authority and at Welsh Government level, in supporting care leavers at every stage of their young lives.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: It will be no surprise to hear that Plaid Cymru is in favour of the care leavers basic income pilot, and there's pleasure that the pilot is ongoing. That has been replaced by disgust at some of the ways that Tory Members across the floor from me have twisted this policy. To those who are peddling dog-whistle politics reminiscent of Trump, I say this, 'You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.'Minister, I'd like to see the timescale set out by the Government, so that when the results of this trial come back\u2014and I anticipate that they will be positive\u2014there are clear markers rolled out, so that extensive basic income can continue. We cannot afford to let a scheme that could be as transformational as this to drift into the ether.&nbsp;\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Peredur, and such an important question. I'm reluctant to go back\u2014but I will do\u2014to say how shocked we were by this attack on our basic income pilot, which came from ill-informed, inaccurate and misleading information that came from the Conservatives. We are clear about that. It wanted to undermine what we were doing, but, most of all, undermine those young people who are most vulnerable in our nation of sanctuary\u2014our unaccompanied asylum seeker children, who have always been included as eligible. And can I put that on the record again for the basic income pilot? As category 3 care leavers\u2014. I have to say to everyone here, you have all got young people, care leavers, in this pilot. Every single local authority in this Chamber has got care leavers in this pilot. Remember that. And they are, I'm sure, wanting to ensure that we are backing them as they go through this important pilot and, of course, as I've said, the comprehensive detailed research and publishing further monitoring data later on this year.But also, just to say, as to those young people we are supporting, we will want, as you have described very clearly, to support them through every entitlement that they have\u2014every entitlement that they have. And that includes a right to claim asylum in the UK.&nbsp;So, I hope we can move on from that, but also, just to say, as far as our care leavers and care-experienced young people are concerned, they are listening and watching what we are saying in this Chamber, backing them in their prospects\u2014and there are prospects\u2014for their life chances and life opportunities.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Mark Isherwood.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Diolch, Llywydd. Your ministerial responsibilities, as you know, include co-ordination of cross-cutting measures to promote prosperity and tackle poverty. Speaking here last October in the debate on a Member's legislative proposal for a take-up of benefits Bill, I challenged the Welsh Government on the actions it had taken to establish a coherent and integrated Welsh benefits system for all the means-tested benefits it is responsible for, as recommended in the 2019 committee report on benefits in Wales. Last month's Bevan Foundation report on a common approach to Welsh benefits stated that they have long called for a single framework of grants and allowances termed a 'Welsh benefits system', that this system would remove the complex and confusing application process and has the potential to lift people out of poverty. Their findings demonstrate that establishing a Welsh benefits system is feasible in terms of data, that millions of pounds of unclaimed benefits could support those on low incomes, and that the regulations governing Welsh benefits are set by a Welsh Government and so it's within their power to introduce regulatory amendment to facilitate greater uniformity.&nbsp;How do you therefore respond to these findings, and what action are you now taking further to the debate last year and to the report last month? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\n"}

The first item today is questions to the First Minister. Question 1, Mike Hedges.&nbsp;\n\nMike Hedges AM: 1. What action is the Welsh Government taking to reduce river pollution? OQ59418\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Mike Hedges, Dirprwy Lywydd, for that question. With ministerial colleagues, I have chaired two summits, bringing together all those bodies and organisations with a responsibility to reduce river pollution. The agreed action plan commits all participants to accelerate the practical measures that each can take to tackle pollution in our waterways\n\nMike Hedges AM: I thank the First Minister for that response. River pollution is a problem across Wales, but I only want to talk about the River Tawe. We have raw sewerage discharge, agricultural pollution and microplastics. Some suggestions: has the Welsh Government considered taking action to stop water run-off mixing with sewerage? Things I belive that could help include the planting of trees and bushes, making it a planning condition on new developments that impervious coverings are not allowed, except for a driveway with limited width, to have greater control over the use of fertiliser on farmland, and to completely ban microplastic use in commonly used materials such as cosmetics.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I thank Mike Hedges for his unfailingly constructive suggestions as to how we might tackle the scourge of river pollution. A number of the points that he has mentioned I think we have embarked upon already. As far as separating water run-off from sewerage, then the future of sustainable drainage systems, I think, is fundamental to making sure that, for all new building developments, we can relieve pressure on the network, redirecting and slowing down the speed at which surface water enters the sewer system.The Member made a number of points about agricultural pollution. Of course, we are committed to making sure that we have greater use control over fertilisers on farmland, and the sustainable farming scheme will contribute to a number of other points that Mike Hedges made. It will offer support to those farmers who choose to take it, to tree plant, particularly along river banks, but also more generally. And as for the point that the Member makes about making the planning condition on new developments, the Minister for Climate Change has undertaken to write to all local authorities, reminding them of the enforcement powers they already have in this regard. There are restrictions on paving over front gardens, for parking or any other purpose, without planning permission. And Mike Hedges is quite right to point to the fact that the way in which, increasingly in urban areas, people have turned what were previously gardens into hard standing and parking, means that there is increased run-off into sewers, adding to the risk of flooding and impacting on water quality. So, I hope the Member can see from that that a range of the suggestions that he has made are being taken forward already, and there are other ideas that he has suggested this afternoon that we will be able to explore and see if they can add to that overall cross-Government effort.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: It's clear, at the moment, that you're getting your action plan together. It is fair to say the UK Conservative Government now has a clear plan for reducing river pollution. By 2035\u2014yes, they're well ahead of the game\u2014water companies will have to improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and they will have to improve 75 per cent of overflows discharged into high-priority nature sites. By 2050, this will apply to all remaining storm overflows covered by our targets regardless of location. Wales has six out of the 20 most polluted rivers in the UK, and I am sure that you will agree that 600,000 hours of dumping into our waterways and our Welsh rivers is completely unacceptable.&nbsp;So, First Minister, would you agree with me and back the stance of the UK Conservative Government\u2014the stance they've taken to address this issue\u2014by holding water companies to account, and, if so, when are you going to do the same here in Wales?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I don't think this is an area in which there is competition between the different nations of the United Kingdom. I believe that we need to reduce river pollution in Wales, and I'm quite sure that the UK Government takes action in England to do the same thing. It is a shared ambition, particularly with rivers that cross the border, where only combined action can have the impact that we wish. Many of the things that the Member has mentioned are happening in Wales. By 2030, D\u0175r Cymru will have reduced their phosphorous pollution loading on our key areas by 90 per cent, and will have reduced it by 100 per cent by 2035. Of course, there is a great deal more that needs to be done. I agree with what the Member said that sewage dumping into rivers is not an acceptable practice, and that the industry has to invest more, and more quickly, to make sure that it tackles that. I believe that, in D\u0175r Cymru, we have a company in Wales, a not-for-profit company, that is able to invest in the Welsh infrastructure without profit taking elsewhere. I think we're fortunate to have a company structured in that way and, I think, with a genuine commitment to playing its part in reducing river pollution.\n\nJane Dodds MS: Good afternoon, First Minister. I live in Hay-on-Wye. The River Wye is the second most polluted river in Wales, after the River Usk, and the River Tawe is the third most polluted river in Wales. Many of us get our postbags filled with people writing to us about the state of our rivers. And I realise it's not a political point, but I am really disappointed that, once again, Conservative MPs voted against taking a tougher stance against sewage dumping by our water companies, something that would have helped us across the UK. I also would take issue in Wales here on D\u0175r Cymru. D\u0175r Cymru executives get paid quite a lot of money\u2014I think \u00a3600,000 was the last payment to a chief executive of D\u0175r Cymru. This is at a time when Wales's water bills are the second highest across the country. May I ask you, in terms of river sewage, First Minister, whether you would support measures to make sewage dumping illegal?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, of course the Member is right in her simple factual point about the way Conservative MPs voted on this issue. If sewage dumping were to be made illegal, then the question would arise as to what happens when storm overflows inevitably cause pressure on the system. And while I'm completely with the Member in wanting to see all of that addressed seriously and quickly, it is simply the fact that combined sewage overflows operate in a way that means that sewage doesn't come through the floors of private businesses and private homes. So, if you banned it tomorrow, you would simply displace the problem and make the problem, I think, even less acceptable to Welsh citizens. The truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that this is a complex issue, where you can only make a difference by gathering together all the different contributions from those who have a part to play. That's why our action plan has buy-in from the Welsh Government, of course, but the regulators, the developers, the farming unions, the water companies, and we will need to see it from communities themselves. In the case of the River Wye, 72 per cent of pollution in the River Wye comes from agricultural sources. So, while I agree that D\u0175r Cymru must play its part, and do it effectively, unless you're prepared to tackle the other sources of river pollution, then you won't make the difference that Jane Dodds and I would like to see.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on train services that run from Bangor along the north Wales coast railway? OQ59456\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Dirprwy Lywydd, many of the mainline services across north Wales are a UK Government responsibility, and they are delivered by Avanti West Coast. Poor performance and inadequate service levels on this essential route has placed additional pressure on regional services run by Transport for Wales and delivered an unacceptable experience for passengers across north Wales.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much. And I agree with that analysis. But, in Bangor, we have one of the busiest stations in the north of Wales, and there are plans afoot to improve the facilities there. But the most far-reaching improvement that could happen for the benefit of rail users in Arfon and beyond is electrification of the north Wales coast line. Some of the funding that is due to Wales as a result of HS2 in England would be able to be used for that electrification. But, as well as investment, we need to have the powers over rail infrastructure and bring those powers here to the Senedd. Will you make the strong case for the devolution of rail infrastructure to the Government, and make that case robustly to the UK Government, and to your own party, indeed?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those supplementaries, Dirprwy Lywydd. And I do agree that we need the full powers over railways, as well as the investment to go along with those powers. We have some powers already, and we have used those powers, as people can see, in the investment into rail lines in the Valleys and in Cardiff. If we could have full powers, then we could do a more comprehensive job of work in order to make things better here in Wales. But, to do that, the powers without the investment simply couldn't work, and that's why Si\u00e2n Gwenllian's points are important for us here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nCarolyn Thomas MS: Bangor station is already an important hub for university students and, now, with Welsh Government investing in a medical school, a dental academy and the National Slate Museum in its programme for government, Bangor station has significantly grown in importance. Do you share my disappointment to see that there will be just five services a day now between north Wales and London from May 2023, with no plans from the UK Government to restore the pre-COVID level of service? By awarding a six-month contract to Avanti, they are delaying a much needed reconsideration of the service provided, and such a short-term offer will not incentivise Avanti to improve the service or resolve any other outstanding issues. So, I am just concerned that this is another kick in the teeth for the people of north Wales and for trying to grow the economy there, and to get people to Bangor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Dirpwy Lywydd, I thank Carolyn Thomas for that. She makes a very important point. The decision of Avanti West Coast to reduce services between north Wales and London was made without any prior notification to the Welsh Government or to Transport for Wales, despite the very obvious knock-on effect onto those local train services. Not only did it arbitrarily reduce those services, but, clearly, that was good enough for the UK Government, because, despite that, they've gone ahead and awarded a six-month contract extension to Avanti West Coast. Now, I am told that Avanti is committed to improving that service. I am glad to see that the new chief executive of Avanti West Coast has offered a meeting with our transport Minister to set out the actions they are taking, but the truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that the problems on the railway are more basic than any single franchise. The way in which rail services are designed and delivered across the United Kingdom simply does not meet the needs of the travelling public. In order to have a more fundamental review, you need what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian said in her original question\u2014you need the powers transferred to Wales and the investment to go alongside it, and then, in the way that we have taken those parts of the railway that are under our control back under public control, we will be able to do that and make a much better job of rail services in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nSam Rowlands MS: My colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian is absolutely right to raise concerns again about the train services in north Wales. And I must say, First Minister, you have a refreshingly honest Deputy Minister for transport who clearly has concerns about the state of the Labour-run rail service here in Wales as well. He was recently quoted as saying that Transport for Wales could be 'awful' and has been 'pretty bleak for a while'. Do you agree with him, First Minister?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: What I agree was the point that the Minister was actually making, because he was pointing to the decision of the UK Government to set out a future for rail services in Wales that can only be one of managed decline. That is the policy of your party and the Government that you support. That is why they have agreed the next period of investment for Network Rail that has Wales at the very foot of the league table. Every other region but one has better investment over the next period than is going to be offered in Wales, despite the fact that investment in the Welsh rail service has been dismal over the whole 13 years in which your Government has been in charge. That was the point the Deputy Minister was making, and it\u2019s one I think any person who takes an objective look at the facts of rail investment in Wales would endorse.\n\nY Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer: We move on now to questions from party leaders, and, first of all, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. Last week, First Minister, the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru issued a damning statement, in fairness, assessing the engagement so far the Welsh Government has had with the UK-wide COVID inquiry. Now, from these benches, we have time and time again said that there should be a Wales-wide independent inquiry; regrettably, the Labour benches have voted that proposal down, so we do rely on, obviously, the Welsh Government engaging with the UK inquiry to make sure that all the facts are presented and can be understood by that inquiry. Can you give us an update on how the Welsh Government is engaging with the COVID inquiry at a UK level? And are you as concerned as I am with the judgment that the COVID bereaved families have around non-disclosure and the timeliness of the evidence that the Welsh Government is submitting to the inquiry?\n\n"}

You're all very welcome.Members have a number of questions to put to you this morning. I realise there's lots to say, but if somebody has said something, I'd encourage you not to repeat it because I just want to make sure everybody gets through questions. I'd like to remind Members to perhaps be as brief as possible in their questioning. So, we'll start off with questions from Buffy Williams. Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you for joining us this morning. How would you describe the situation of foster placements in Wales? For example, are enough of the right types of placements in the right geographical locations?\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Who wants to start?&nbsp;\n\nSarah Thomas: I'll start.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Thank you, Sarah.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Thomas: I'd say that we do not have enough placements, full stop. We do not have a foster carer for every child who needs them, and they're certainly not living in the location that the child needs them to live in. Some of the barriers that we have to placing children locally is the way that we have a current marketplace, which means that foster carers are free to foster with whom they choose, and that's a very good thing for lots of foster carers, but if we don't utilise and access them in the same way that a local authority can access their foster carers, then we prevent children from being placed within their own locality. The children who are most likely to remain in school, to remain able to attend their clubs and activities and to have a thriving opportunity are the ones who have a foster placement as close to their home location as possible, when it's safe to do so. Local authorities will know all of their foster carers within their LA, and they need to improve, I believe, in the way that they utilise each other and also the systems that are in place to utilise those providers who are external and may have a foster carer right on the front door of where that child needs it, but they can't access it as easily because of the systems and structures we have in place.&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Is there anybody else? Matt.&nbsp;\n\nMatt Lewis: No, we certainly don't echo Sarah's point on that. My view is that we will never have enough suitable families for the number of children because of the framework we're working under, which is actually part of the problem at the moment. So, I think, in terms of radical reform, it's urgently needed of the entire system. Fostering for the foster parents is really complex and challenging. They lack support. They're under a huge amount of scrutiny from the child protection framework and the regulations. So, it is a very difficult place at the moment.&nbsp;The other problem we have is that the poverty, the trauma in our communities, is very serious. The children who come in from the referrals to our service are the worst we've ever seen. Children are routinely not being fed, starved, dehydrated, locked in cupboards, with serious sexual abuse. So, these children need support in their communities to stop the flow-through into care, and the foster families need a different type of recognition and different frameworks for support.\n\nMike Anthony: I'd also add as well that, in some ways, we've always had that problem, and, ever since I've been in social work and fostering, we've had problems recruiting foster carers. But I think it's even worse now, exacerbated by things post pandemic. The sorts of people that we are looking for, traditionally, are people who've got a spare room\u2014financial, cost-of-living crisis, all those things have come together as well. So, we're actually losing some of the people that we would've traditionally perhaps been able to access as well, so there are additional pressures. And we're also finding single foster carers are struggling within the current climate as well, because it is one of those roles that people have to make a big decision about, whether they can afford to foster, and the climate at the moment is super challenging.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Buffy.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you. Can you tell us about the main challenges facing fostering in Wales at the moment, and what are the key priorities to address them?\n\nSarah Thomas: Yes, go for it.\n\nMatt Lewis: The main challenges are that the children are coming in with undiagnosed but very recognisable lifelong conditions such as complex post-traumatic stress, which is created by the birth family members who have terrorised their children and severely hurt the children. They're also severely neglected, and that neglect creates a lifelong learning difficulty. So, the kind of expectations are that these children will develop mental progress if you put them in the right place that's alongside other children, and the fact of the matter is, simply, the outcomes tell us that that's not true. I think of our service\u2014people who've been doing it a long time\u2014and we do everything we can to support the children, but managing their environments and keeping it safe, calm, playful, taking them back to early years experience, and keeping the anxiety at bay is the best chance that we have to help them.We also think much more like an adoptive service than a fostering service. So, success for us is that our children stay with our families for the rest of their lives; they're not encouraged to move out when they're 16, as they currently are. We know that children leaving care at 16 or 18 are likely to have their own children and then begins the cycle again, which leads to more potential removals of children. So, fostering should be viewed as a permanent option. It should be a family like any other. We don't use the word 'placement', because the children get very confused by it. So, there's a huge amount of challenge, but that would be where I would start at the moment\u2014recognising that children need far more support across a life journey than they're currently getting.\n\nSarah Thomas: I think I would add, on that note, really, stability is the greatest challenge that we face for our young people. We are currently unable to ensure that, when we remove them from their family, where we take away the people who were meant to fight for them and protect them\u2014. We do that and then we fail to offer an alternative that is better than that on lots of occasions, because we're unable to create that permanency, to ensure the best possible match, because of the lack of provision that we have within the fostering sector. And then, on top of that, we don't necessarily structure our services in the way that they are driven to meet the needs of the child. At the moment, our services are meeting the needs of those who work within them, or meeting the financial pressures, rather than focusing on\u2014. It feels to me like we've sort of lost track of what good outcomes are and what it is that we're all here to do, and what we're striving to achieve seems to have become slightly diluted in the fact that our services aren't able to do what many of them would like to do.\n\nMike Anthony: And I think some of that has been impacted hugely by the social work crisis as well in staffing. We're dealing with many foster placements where the turnover of social workers\u2014. There are massive delays, as Matt was describing, and a complexity of what we're dealing with with the needs of the children, and there's a real inconsistency quite often, or changes in social workers, and some of the teams are running at 30 per cent social work and carrying vacancies or agency staff. One of the good things about being in fostering, as an agency for a long time, as well, is that there's continuity in our fostering teams, but in the social work teams the churn is enormous, and that has massive implications for the services that you get. Delays in therapy: we might have a referral going to therapy, the social worker changes, the team leader changes, and you're knocked back in the work that's going on. So, I think the current crisis in social work is enormous as well.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth Bryan: Yes, for the child to have an adult who knows them well making a decision for them, I think some of them probably feel that that isn't the case because there hasn't been a consistency for them. And then, when they make their own decisions\u2014. I think we spoke earlier this morning in our event about how they're expected to make a lot of big decisions by themselves when they're 18, but they've not been supported to do that; it's not scaffolded through their life because there isn't that consistency from a trusted adult. I think that's really key.\n\nMike Anthony: I think it actually does the opposite as well, doesn't it? In some cases, it's actually teaching some of our children and young people not to trust or invest in some of the adults that are working with them. So, it's a by-product of that, which is absolutely the opposite of what we're trying to achieve.\n\nRhian Carter: We also find there's poor provision. So, a lot of our children struggle in mainstream school, and even the specialist provisions are not fit for what the children need. In terms of the trauma, we find the children just can't cope with an education environment, and they really, really struggle. Family contact is also a huge issue. You're sending a child to see their abuser. So, it often retraumatises the children, and the lead-up to contact and after contact can be horrendous for our children in terms of bed-wetting, soiling. It sends them backwards, really, so they're not able to have that safe time away from their perpetrators.\n\nMatt Lewis: Rhian's right. There are two things that we've identified that break down long-term foster families, and that is the wrong education provision because the children simply do not function at their chronological age in the way that mainstream education thinks they do. So, at 18, the children are much more like four years of age in the emotional developmental stage\u2014they still can't do friendships, can't manage relationships, or money, for example. The other thing is that the children have been highly terrorised and traumatised by birth families, and when we show them the perpetrators of their abuse, our current framework suggests that that's a good thing, but if you look at the underlying neurological, psychological impact on the child, it pulls them back into that abusive system. So, we create on our own\u2014. We've got a clinical issue in terms of the way in which the brain is affected by neurology that isn't recognised by the welfare and the rights-based system that we currently work within.\n\nRhian Carter: And also life story work. Children often have this piece of work done, often sharing information they never knew about or can't remember, and then they're planting memories and stories into their brains that they just cannot cope with\u2014\n\nMatt Lewis: They can't process it.\n\nRhian Carter: \u2014and they just can't process.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Just one more quick question, Chair\u2014\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Yes, absolutely.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: \u2014maybe to Matt. You spoke about children who have been seriously sexually abused, exploited and terrorised. Is there enough expert care\u2014quality expert care\u2014out there to support these children within the care sector?\n\nMatt Lewis: I think, unfortunately\u2014. I've been working in these services a long time\u2014youth justice Merthyr and children with disabilities. There's a kind of myth\u2014a hopeful myth\u2014of recovery; we kind of hope that people will get better. Now, we know, as adults, if any of us have had some difficulty, we're always managing that difficulty. But, what we've got with our children are very, very serious developmental issues and traumatic problems that the system currently doesn't recognise; it's not making connections between them as victims of very serious perpetrators and what that means for lifelong belonging, if that's the only family you're allowed to belong in. I don't think the current system thinks clinically deep enough about the state in which children come out of what are very dangerous family settings. So, the short answer is 'no', unfortunately. There's simply not enough expertise.\n\nMike Anthony: I think, even when there is the expertise, sometimes you're trying to get to that, and sometimes the waiting lists are so long in child and adolescent mental health services. It's a pretty broken system, I think. That's why sometimes, like in our own lives, we have to sometimes bypass that, and parents will look to get their own services bought in or whatever. I think, with placements, sometimes, we're seeing placements break down, and not just placements break down, but we're seeing foster carers dealing with highly traumatised children, not getting the services the children need, and then we're seeing breakdowns in placements and losing foster carers because it can be such a difficult and impactful experience, managing such traumatised children.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Thanks, Buffy. A question now from James Evans. James.&nbsp;\n\nJames Evans MS: You're never quite sure here who's going to mute you or unmute you, sometimes. I am looking at my other screen, I am Chair, because I can't look at the small screen, my eyes go funny. Thank you.&nbsp;We've heard of the huge disruption and upset that children and young people experience when they have to move from placement to placement, especially at short notice, after the trauma of being removed from their birth family. Statistics do show that more than a quarter of children have had two or more placements in the last 12 months alone. Why are there so many placement moves and, to what extent is this because of a child's own needs, as opposed to it being because the placement is needed for another child coming into the system? I can't see any of you, so you'll have to jump in as and when. Chair, I'll have to hand over to you to bring people in, because I can't see you.&nbsp;\n\nJayne Bryant AM: That's no problem. Who wants to start. Sian? Sarah?\n\n"}

Rhun ap Iorwerth is requesting a cost-benefit analysis of the scheme."], "answer": "A", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Laura Anne Jones.&nbsp;\n\nLaura Anne Jones AM: 1. What consideration did the Welsh Government give to the Scottish gender recognition reform Bill when creating the 'LGBTQ+ Action Plan for Wales'? OQ59239\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. The commitment to seek devolved powers related to gender recognition, and to support our trans communities, was included in our programme for government and is part of the co-operation agreement. The LGBTQ+ action plan has included this commitment since its first draft. These are policies made in Wales, not in Scotland.\n\nLaura Anne Jones AM: First Minister, last month, you stated your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill with the release of your LGBTQ+ action plan, which intends to make it easier for biological males to enter women-only spaces, push gender ideology in schools, and unfairness in sport. First Minister, there was outrage in Scotland at the gender recognition reform Bill, with polling consistently showing that the Scottish public did not agree with the move. And it's clear from public opinion across Wales and the UK that people see the importance of protecting women and girls, and why such a Bill would put that in jeopardy. Yet, you still push ahead with your plans. Did you learn nothing from the debacle in Scotland? This move to copy Scotland would only serve to deny biological fact and appease a small minority in your party. Men and women up and down the country are genuinely concerned with your blinkered vision on this, and are also concerned by the shadow Secretary of State's sharing images directly from your Welsh Labour conference inciting hate against those standing up for women and girls. First Minister, do you condone their behaviour, and do you finally understand the genuine concern at your plan and your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, transgender people who are going through the process to change their legal sex deserve our respect, support and understanding. That is what the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland said on the floor of the House of Commons when introducing the Government's proposal to block the gender recognition Act in Scotland. I think the Member could do very well to take what the Secretary of State for Scotland said to heart, and think about what she has said on the floor of the Senedd this afternoon through that lens.&nbsp;There is nothing in what this Government intends to do that would merit the description that the Member has offered us here this afternoon. We will pursue, as I said in my original answer, Llywydd, not policies developed elsewhere, but policies that we will develop here in Wales\u2014policies that were in our manifesto, on which we were elected, policies that have been there in our programme for government since the start of this Senedd term, and policies that are set out in more detail in the LGBTQ+ action plan, with its 46 different policy proposals. Those are based on that sense of respect, support and understanding, and if this debate was more characterised by those qualities, it would be a lot better for it.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the Government's response to the roads review? OQ59264\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Rhun ap Iorwerth. The Government\u2019s response was set out by the Deputy Minister for Climate Change in a statement to the Senedd on 14 February.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Simply put, what I'm asking the First Minister to do today is to hold a genuine review of the decision not to proceed with the scheme for the Menai crossing. I note that the Burns commission has received a request to look at different options. I have put forward an argument to that commission for reviving this scheme. Of course, the roads review's focus on the environment was mainly the basis for the announcement. But I have a copy here of the consultation on the options for what kind of bridge to construct and what route to follow, and it shows that the Welsh Government itself selected the scheme that would be most damaging in terms of the impact on biodiversity and the environment, and would create the biggest increase in traffic. And it shows too that smaller schemes would be more cost-effective, potentially.&nbsp; I have to say that I had foreseen something simpler\u2014the dualling of the Britannia, to all intents and purposes, with active travel routes.So, I want the First Minister to look again at the original needs for the crossing and how to deliver them, and at the need to improve safety, opportunities for active travel, and the economic boost that comes from having a more resilient crossing\u2014for delivering on the free port, for example. The roads review itself shows that a new bridge would deliver all of those benefits. And part of the work, Llywydd, which needs to be done urgently, is to look again at how we can deliver that in a way that has the least negative impact on the environment. Will the First Minister agree to do that?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I recall the context at the time when the then First Minister said that we would be continuing with the third crossing across the Menai strait, because I was Minister for finance at that time, and the context was that of Wylfa B. And I remember everything that we discussed at that time with the company responsible for the Wylfa B project\u2014whether it was possible to draw funding in for a third crossing, because there would be far more traffic flowing to Anglesey and off Anglesey. I also recall the discussions with the National Grid, and the original suggestion from the National Grid was to create a tunnel under the strait, and we were discussing with them whether it would be possible to use that funding to help with the cost of a bridge. So, the context has fundamentally changed, hasn\u2019t it, because everything that was on the table with Wylfa B isn\u2019t there now.But what I can tell the Member today is what is set out in our plan. We say that we want to see options for a crossing of the Menai in a way that helps us in our effort to create a shift in the way in which people currently travel. We\u2019ve asked Lord Burns and the commission looking into transport in north Wales to look at how we can do that and to make recommendations to Government on that basis. And that\u2019s how we want to proceed. We are open to whatever Lord Burns recommends, and everything that was contained within the report that Rhun ap Iorwerth has referred to this afternoon is available to Lord Burns and the commission that he leads.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: The national road traffic projections 2022 study, published by the UK Department for Transport in January, shows that road traffic in Wales and England could grow by as much as 54 per cent between 2025 and 2060, with a 22 per cent rise under the core scenario, and the most modest estimate being an 8 per cent increase. Despite this, under all the projections, emissions are projected to fall by as much as 98 per cent as motorists move towards greener vehicles. However, following publication of the Welsh roads review, your Government stopped or scrapped all but 17 of 55 road projects, including all but one of 16 projects in north Wales. Whilst I've long opposed the red route in Flintshire, many of these projects were badly needed, from work on the Menai crossing referred to, to the scrapping of plans to upgrade the A483 around Wrexham. And only yesterday, their council leader told me this was a broken promise, which had already cost them hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Welsh Government millions. What, if any, action will you therefore now take to ensure the well-being of future generations by planning ahead to meet the needs identified in the 2022 road traffic projections study?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, there are some basic things that the Member needs to take into account, particularly when he refers to the needs of future generations. The crisis of our time is a crisis of climate change, and it is those future generations, if we do not act now, which will be left with the consequences of our refusal to face up to that challenge. The roads review is the first root-and-branch review of road building in Wales for many generations. It challenges received wisdom on road building, but it needs to challenge that received wisdom because it is that received wisdom that has got us into the position we are in today. We have to reduce our carbon emissions. Transport makes up 15 per cent of our total emissions in Wales and it has been the most stubborn sector in reducing those emissions. That's why we have to face up to that fact and take the action that will leave those future generations in a better place than they would be. If we simply accepted those very challenging figures that Mark Isherwood set out in the opening of his supplementary question, are we prepared simply to see a future in which traffic goes on growing in that way and emissions go on growing alongside it? Well, this Government is not. That is why we have the roads review, and that is why, when it comes to schemes such as the Menai and such as Wrexham, we're not saying there isn't a problem, we're not saying there isn't something that needs to be done; we're simply saying that the plans of the future have to be based on our responsibilities to tackle that climate emergency, and simply carrying on with the solutions of the past is guaranteed to make that problem worse and not better.&nbsp;\n\nVikki Howells AM: Fist Minister, you will, of course, be aware that for any projects that weren't given the green light by the roads review, the advice to local authorities has been to go back to the drawing board and to consider, in accordance with WelTAG 1, alternative measures to mitigate, for example, local problems of road safety. What specific help can Welsh Government provide to local authorities around this? And, most importantly, are there any plans to revise the criteria for the Welsh Government's road safety grant, for which evidence must be provided to show serious or fatal road traffic incidents before a local authority is able to gain financial assistance?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, can I thank Vikki Howells for what is a very timely question. Llywydd, the road safety framework for Wales dates back as far as 2013, and, although there was a midway review of it in 2018, now is the time when we need to bring forward a new road safety strategy, one that will align with 'Llwybr Newydd' and the national transport delivery plan. And because the roads review is about reprioritising the investment we make on roads, it means that money that might have been spent on new roads can be reprioritised into improving existing road infrastructure, and, of course, that does include safety as well. When the Minister brings forward the new road safety document, then reviewing grant criteria will be developed alongside that new strategy, and I know that the Minister's officials are very happy to discuss specific schemes with local authorities in that context.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. With your permission, Presiding Officer, I'd like to put on the record that our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the man who was killed yesterday in the tragedy in Swansea, and, also, I'm pleased to hear that two of the three people who went into hospital have now been discharged, and thank the emergency services and first responders at what must have been an apocalyptic scene when they arrived there to deal with the fallout from whatever the report into it will determine caused that devastating scene that we saw in the news reels last night and in the papers today.&nbsp;First Minister, last week, one of your Ministers called the Royal College of Nursing an 'extremely militant' organisation. He also said they were'determined to have a fight',and aren't seriously willing to negotiate. That's a direct quote. Is that your take on the RCN and the dispute that they're engaged with with your Government over nurses' pay? &nbsp;\n\n"}

I'll ask the witnesses to introduce themselves for the record, and I'll go to Oliver first.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: If you could introduce yourself, please, for the record.\n\nOliver Carpenter: Can everyone hear me?\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Yes.\n\nOliver Carpenter: Fantastic. My name's Oliver Carpenter. I'm the policy executive at Chambers Wales. We are focused mainly on helping businesses, all day, every day. That is what we do. And, as a result, this inquiry will be very useful into learning and to give information for you all how Wales and Ireland can work together to further business interests.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Diolch, Oliver. Thank you. I'll ask Amanda to introduce herself, please, for the record.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: Amanda Wilkinson. I'm the director at Universities Wales. Universities Wales is the body representing Welsh universities.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. And I'll ask Berwyn to introduce himself.\n\nBerwyn Davies: Good morning. I'm Berwyn Davies. I'm head of the Welsh Higher Education Brussels office, representing the universities here in Brussels.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you to you all for being with us this morning. We'll move straight to questions, if that's okay, and we'll go first to Heledd Fychan.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you, Chair, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Clearly, there is a strong link and relationship between Wales and Ireland. What I'd like to ask you initially this morning is your view on the importance of these relations with regard to the sectors you represent.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Who would like&nbsp;to go first?\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Anyone who wants to go first, if you want to raise your hand.&nbsp;\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: I'll go to Amanda first.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: So, from a university point of view, relationships with Ireland are very important. We've worked very strategically with colleagues in Ireland through the INTERREG&nbsp;programme. We've also undertaken quite a lot of learning with colleagues in Ireland over the years, and it's fundamentally informed the development of things like our Global Wales programme, our big international programme. So, I think, both in terms of the education international approach and research links, it's been a very important relationship for us.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Does anyone else want to go? Berwyn. Can we unmute Berwyn, please? Great.\n\nBerwyn Davies: So, just to add to that, INTERREG&nbsp;has definitely been an important funding source, but so have the framework programmes in the past. I wouldn't say Ireland is at the top of our list of historical partnerships, but they are very important. We've had, I think, 19 projects with Irish partners in Horizon 2020, the previous programme. We haven't really got the data for Horizon Europe in terms of relations with Ireland. But Ireland is an extremely successful country in terms of Horizon 2020. I think it reached its targets of getting \u20ac1.2 billion out of Horizon 2020. So, it's an important partner for us to partner in that European context as well, in terms of research.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. Before I go back to see whether Oliver wants to contribute, Hefin wants to ask a question.\n\nHefin David AM: Yes. Can I just come back to Amanda? I'm just wondering, from a universities perspective, are there any franchised arrangements, franchised courses in Ireland\u2014any of the kind of international arrangements that we see across the world?\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: Sorry, do you mean franchising within Ireland?\n\nHefin David AM: Yes, franchising within Ireland. Yes, or any other kind.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: I don't know the answer to that, Hefin, but I can check and find out for you.\n\nHefin David AM: Okay. I'm just wondering about the relationships between universities here and higher education in the country and whether there's the development of the kinds of partnership links you'd see with, say, Greece or China, or anything like that.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: I'm not aware of those sorts of relationships with Ireland, Hefin, but I will check, but not as commonly as you would find with other countries and other regions.\n\nHefin David AM: Okay, thanks.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thanks for that.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Oliver, did you want to add anything to this?\n\nOliver Carpenter: Yes. I would say that, from a business perspective, a decent portion of Welsh trade is with Ireland, but there's a great opportunity for there to be more that's done through the Celtic connection and through sectors that would benefit both Ireland and Wales\u2014so, tourism, manufacturing, travel, that kind of thing.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: If I can just pick up from that point, then, what do you think needs to happen to facilitate that? What are the barriers at the moment?\n\nOliver Carpenter: That's a good question. There's the general barrier of the economy at the moment, which isn't very conducive to trade. Obviously, recently, with the Windsor framework that's recently come in with Northern Ireland, that's slightly eased trading tensions between the UK and Northern Ireland, and, as a proxy, that will affect the likelihood of Wales's trade to Northern Ireland and therefore Wales to Ireland as well.&nbsp;I would say that one of the barriers is, therefore, the economy, and I would say partially its infrastructure. We know that soon in Wales we're going to hopefully be getting a free port, potentially, an economic investment zone, and that will help as well. And then, also, it's probably partially political will as well. I think there needs to be more done from those in Welsh Government to push for trade with Ireland.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you. If I can just pick up more generally, then, you've mentioned some of the challenges. Obviously, the B word\u2014Brexit\u2014is something that came through strongly in terms of the evidence received prior to this, and especially with some of the universities, in terms of projects and so on. Can I just ask, therefore, in terms of some of the challenges that you're seeing\u2014I think it was the evidence that suggested some of the challenges between movement of students, collaboration with Erasmus, et cetera\u2014if you could expand on some of the impacts of Brexit and some of the challenges that we need to overcome if we're to continue to develop these relationships? I don't know who might want to go first.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Berwyn or Amanda? Amanda.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: I was going to say that Berwyn can probably answer that a little bit better than I can. In relation to Erasmus, as you know, it's obviously been a significant loss for universities, and I think we've been very pleased that we've been able to set up the Taith programme here in Wales to help support those mobilities. Of course, it can't exactly replicate Erasmus. But, we do have, I think, over and above other UK nations, more levers to support mobility, and that is important to us. And, of course, Irish students are treated as home students, so that's also very helpful.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Berwyn.\n\nBerwyn Davies: So, we haven't got the data for Taith at the moment in terms of higher education into Ireland. We've got, I believe, a global figure, and there's also, of course, the Turing programme that does allow Welsh students to go abroad, and we're looking to get data from that as well. We don't know yet whether there has been any outward mobility to Ireland, but I think, in the evidence that Aberystwyth gave, and also, I think, Bangor as well, I think Bangor accounts for about 21 per cent of Irish students in Wales, and there are key partnerships there in terms of degree mobility as well. So, the question really is to maintain and to build on those collaborations and exchanges.&nbsp;\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: If I may, therefore, as you referred to the evidence from Aberystwyth University, well, Professor Treasure was quite honest with us in terms of her discontent, perhaps, that very little progress had been made in terms of ensuring that relations continued as a result of Brexit, and one of the issues was that European Union funding for the projects that she listed was expected to come to an end and that there isn't a great deal of hope for a continuation of those projects at the moment. Does that reflect the sector's view more widely, that there is genuine concern that some projects aren't going to be able to continue? I want to understand who you think should be looking at these issues and what the role of the Welsh Government is in that regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Berwyn.\n\nBerwyn Davies: The Government has been active and doing as much as they can, for example, in creating this new fund, Agile Cymru, which tries to keep some of those relationships going. It doesn't take INTERREG's place at all in terms of the investment that can be put into it. So, there will be a big question about that funding in the future. I think one of the most important things, of course, is whether we'll be able to join Horizon Europe. It would give us a great boost to be able to continue with these partnerships\u2014for example, in looking at whether some of the projects that have been funded through INTERREG are then able to apply to Horizon Europe, if we are able to join that programme as a full member.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you. Amanda, do you have anything to add?\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: This is part of a wider problem that we have in relation to the structural funds, but it's true for the INTERREG projects as well, that we haven't seen a replacement of funds that we might be expecting and that universities are largely cut out of eligibility for a lot of replacement funds. So, I think this is an issue, and I think it's something we need to think about very carefully here in Wales\u2014what are the key projects that are really going to matter to us, going forward, and which of these might we wish to bridge into potential Horizon Europe projects? Because, even if we're successful in associating with the next Horizon programme, then I still think we're going to have a period where we have to get some of these projects to work and be successful. So, there's still an issue, I think, around how we bridge some of them, if we wish to keep some of these joint projects with Ireland going.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Who's leading those conversations at the moment? Obviously, concerns have been raised, and you're saying you're hoping, et cetera, but who's driving that at the moment? Do you think there's enough clarity, or are concerns being listened to? I'm just trying to understand how we can ensure that some of the unanswered questions following Brexit are addressed, so that there's clarity for the sector.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: So, we've done quite a bit of work focusing on Westminster in the last three months. I do think what happens with the next round of prosperity funding does matter if we're going to keep some of these projects going. And if we can't keep them going, then we need to think fairly strategically about which of these projects are going to be the most important to us. Because, at the moment, there's not an obvious place for universities to go.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you. If I may, Oliver, I saw you agreeing in terms of the funding there and clarity. Perhaps you'd want to expand in terms of your sector.\n\n"}

The first item on the agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is to be answered by the Deputy Minister, and to be asked by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 1. What plans does the Welsh Government have in place to help the young people of Arfon with the costs of traveling on public transport? OQ59096\n\nLee Waters AM: Diolch. One of the aims of 'Llwybr Newydd', the Wales transport strategy, is to reduce the cost of sustainable travel for everyone in Wales, including young people. We are working towards an accessible transport system across the nation and have a number of initiatives aimed at younger travellers.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: It's good to hear that there are plans in the pipeline, and, of course, we need to extend them and to bring new plans forward too. But in rural parts of my constituency, it's not the cost of travelling on buses that's the only problem. There's a lack of bus services in the first instance, with some communities without a way to travel at all at times, because there are no trains, metro, appropriate cycling routes, nor are there bus services at some times of the day. Now, Yr Orsaf in Penygroes is developing a project to support residents, including young people, who face barriers because of a lack of public transport in dyffryn Nantlle, with the support of the dyffryn Nantlle community transport partnership. Is community transport an area that you as a Deputy Minister want to see developing in the future, and, if this is a priority for you, how much funding has been earmarked for encouraging this kind of transport in the Government's draft budget for the next financial year?\n\nLee Waters AM: Thank you. A number of points there. I'm familiar with the work of Partneriaeth Ogwen and have visited some of their schemes\u2014they're an outstanding organisation. I was particularly struck by the scheme we've been funding them for to retrofit bicycles, to add a battery to them, which, particularly in rural areas, particularly hilly areas, is a really practical thing that we can do to help people who don't have easy access to a car or to public transport. We know that, for generations, we've been favouring investment into road schemes, for those people who have cars, and, over time, have been neglecting public transport, and we've seen usage decline, we've seen routes shrink and we've seen fares go up. So, that is one of the reasons why we're bringing forward our bus Bill, to redesign the service, and it's one of the reasons why we'll be publishing the roads review next Tuesday, to, over time, shift resource from car-based schemes to schemes for everyone.In the meantime, we do have some really difficult financial challenges, and we are seeing bus schemes being withdrawn, which illustrates the problem we have with the privatised system, because there is no strategic overview to this\u2014it's being done randomly by bus companies. And then, we have the further problem, particularly in rural Wales, where bus companies are struggling to keep their business model going, and the cost of energy is really stopping them being able to run routes, and they're not tendering for fresh services. So, we have a range of challenges facing us, but the fundamental problem is the lack of investment that we have. Because we have prioritised other things, including as part of the co-operation agreement. We could have chosen to prioritise public transport; we chose other things, and we have to do the best we can with what we've got. But, clearly, as part of our modal shift and the net-zero targets, we need to shift resource far more into public transport.\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I just want to echo the comments raised by the Member for Arfon, and recognise that this important focus is required on public transport, especially for rural areas, in areas like Arfon and across north Wales\u2014the region I represent, of course. Deputy Minister, I'm sure you are an avid reader of the Welsh Conservative manifesto, especially the one for the 2021 Senedd elections. In that, we as Conservatives called for free bus travel and discounted rail travel for 16 to 24-year-olds, to help our young people access education, training and employment. This of course could embed that modal shift that you and I are so keen to see, whilst also supporting our environment, so importantly. So, in light of this, Minister, what consideration have you and the Welsh Government given to this type of idea, to see that free access to buses for our young people, so we can see that modal shift whilst also supporting our environment? Thank you very much.\n\nLee Waters AM: Well, there's no doubt that, if we had lower prices, we'd have higher use. There are schemes right across the world, including free bus use in Normandy and elsewhere, and free bus schemes in Wales, in Cardiff and Swansea and Newport, for short periods, which have shown an uptake in usage. So, we know that, when fares drop, people are more likely to use it. There's no shortage of opportunities and ideas to increase usage and to reduce fares, and incentivise people to use public transport. The challenge always is the resource. So, I'm not sure how the Conservatives plan to fund that initiative that they had in their manifesto, but there are no easy options that I'm aware of to do just that.We do have an offer on buses where people aged between 16 and 21 have a third off an adult bus ticket, and we've been doing a lot of work, as part of our commitment to a fairer fares regime, to model what we could achieve if we had much lower bus fares. And the figures are all very encouraging; the resource is the challenge.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: 2. What support is the Welsh Government providing for coastal communities facing the threat of flooding? OQ59079\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Janet. The Welsh Government is investing \u00a3293 million in reducing flood risk to coastal communities across Wales through our coastal risk management programme. This will reduce flood risk to over 15,000 properties, and includes, for example, more than \u00a319 million of investment in Aberconwy. An interactive map showing our investment is published online.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Minister. I'm sure you're aware that, in 2014, our lovely sandy beach, north shore, Llandudno, received, without any notice, the dumping of some 50,000 tonnes of freshly and dirty quarried rock. At the time, it was described as 'shingle'. The town was in uproar, with residents, visitors and business owners still angry to this day. I can recall our sea washing up a white, milky froth for around three weeks, whilst this was described at the time as 'clean and inert shingle.'&nbsp;Now, in 2023\u2014well, sooner than that, actually\u2014we're now aware of the several options that have been brought forward to you to bring forward a new sea water flood defence scheme. One of the options is to implement a scheme that would replace sand, and stage 1 was even supported. I cannot overemphasise my immense disappointment that this scheme now will not be supported, as you feel that the cost outweighs the aesthetic benefits of using sand renourishment. Llandudno is the queen of the Welsh resorts, and the jewel in the crown\u2014&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: I'm going to have to call you to ask your question now, because I'm about to ask you to ask your spokespeople questions, of which there are three. So, can you ask your question?\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What steps, Minister, can you take? How do we move forward on this? What steps will you take to ensure that we have the right sea defences we need, but that, at some stage, we can see our sandy beach restored in Llandudno? Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nJulie James AM: Yes, thank you, Janet. So, just to be really specific, the Welsh Government have recently awarded grant funding to Conwy County Borough Council to develop a full business case for Llandudno, based on maintaining and improving the existing cobble defence on the north shore. The alternative sand option provides no additional flood benefit, at a much greater cost to the coastal risk management programme, and that's the problem. So, whilst I completely understand what you're saying about the sandy beach, the coastal risk management programme is for coastal risk management; it's not for tourist attractions and other aesthetic value. I'm not denying the value of that; I'm just saying that's not what the programme is for.&nbsp;So, if Conwy County Borough Council want to get an alternative sand option at Llandudno north shore, they really need to look for alternative sources of funding. There are some other sources of funding available, but, in all conscience, I cannot take a coastal management programme that's specifically designed to protect places from flooding and use it for a completely different purpose. So, whilst I have some sympathy with what you're saying, this is not the right programme for it. And, you can tell from the amount of money that we've invested around the coast of Wales that we are really trying to get as many properties protected from actual flooding as possible. Clearly, we do try to do that in the most environmentally and aesthetically pleasing way possible, but, in the end, it's down to how many properties we protect. So, I'm sure you'll be able to work with the council to get a better option, but not through this funding model.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Janet Finch-Saunders.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Diolch, Llywydd, and thank you, Minister, Now, there is no denying that the UK Government is taking decisive action to tackle unsafe buildings. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP has sent all developers legally binding contracts that will commit them to pay to repair these unsafe buildings. This contract will see developers commit an estimated \u00a32 billion or more for repairs to buildings that they've developed or refurbished over the past 30 years, and protect thousands of leaseholders living in hundreds of buildings across England.&nbsp;In England, the UK Government is looking to prevent developers from operating freely in the housing market if they fail to sign and comply with the remediation contract. Will you do the same for those operating in Wales who either refuse to sign or breach the terms of the Welsh Government's developers pact?\n\n"}

The Wales fuel support scheme; it has not had a significant impact on households."], "answer": "C", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: So, with no further ado, I'd like to welcome our witnesses today: Peter Tutton from StepChange, Luke Young from Citizens Advice, and Steffan Evans from the Bevan Foundation. Welcome to you. Thank you very much, StepChange and Citizens Advice, for your written evidence. I'm just about to find my script, which is here. Could you just briefly summarise\u2014? Sorry, Sioned, did you want to\u2014?\n\nSioned Williams MS: Sorry, Chair. I'm also a member of the Bevan Foundation.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Sorry, apologies I didn't see you earlier.So, if you could briefly just tell us what the latest impact of the cost-of-living pressures are, highlighting any particular groups that you think are worst affected. I know this is included in your written evidence, but I think it's really a question of reflecting on how things have changed in the last 12 months or so. I don't know whether, Peter Tutton, you'd like to go first, just as you're online. Welcome, Peter Tutton, of StepChange.\n\nPeter Tutton: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, committee, for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here. Apologies I can't be with you in person and I'm dialling in. But, thanks for having me. I'll see what I can do to help you.So, what's happened? It's been a bit funny over the last year. So, certainly, we can see that the cost-of-living increases are having an impact. So, we started recording towards the end of last year the proportion of clients saying that the cost-of-living increases were significant, and that was about 9 per cent if you go back to the end of 2021. We're up to sort of 22 per cent and rising now. So, clearly, more and more people are being drawn to debt advice specifically because of the cost of living.In terms of who we're seeing, generally speaking it's a continuity from both COVID and also the decade before that debt is still largely about people who have less financial resilience, people who are on lower incomes, disproportionately people like single parents, women in general are disproportionate in our client loads, people with responsibility for children, and renters in particular. So, about two thirds of our clients are renters, which is almost the other way around to the overall tenure occupancy. And, particularly, private sector tenants have become increasingly prominent in our case loads over the last decade, but that seems to be accelerating a bit with the cost-of-living crisis.In addition, over half our clients\u2014. It's a regulatory requirement for us, as we're regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, to look and see whether our clients have additional needs because of vulnerable circumstances, and over half our clients fit into that category. That typically means people who are experiencing some degree of mental ill health or physical ill health or physical disabilities.So, debt is really about at the moment, and has been largely about, people on low incomes, maybe more distant from the labour market, low financial resilience, not much in the way of assets to fall back on, and perhaps extra living costs like childcare and so on, and now, of course, things like fuel costs as well.That all said, one of the things that we have seen over the past year is we're starting to see an increase in households who haven't necessarily had financial difficulties before. So, with many of the people we see, those financial difficulties can repeat because the underlying income vulnerabilities and financial resilience vulnerabilities don't change. But, we're seeing more people, which is one of the things we saw with COVID, who hadn't been in this situation before. Over half our clients are in some form of employment\u2014many of them are low income whilst being in employment\u2014and about 40 per cent are in full-time employment, and that's grown a bit, and the cost of living is certainly putting more people who are higher up the income scale under pressure. So, one of the things we've seen with our existing clients on debt solutions, who are paying their debts over a period of time, over the year we've seen quite a lot of those people having to reduce those payments or ask for payment holidays because of the cost of living. But, at the same time, we're seeing new people come in who actually have got more money. So, in a sense, the cost of living is doing two things. It's pushing people who are already vulnerable to debt further into a place where they're more likely to be negative-budget clients, who are really going to struggle to keep up with the essentials and, perhaps even after debt advice, struggle to keep up with the essentials. But, also, it's pushing up-the-income-scale people who are vulnerable to debt and it's bringing households that, before the cost-of-living crisis, as you might expect, were not vulnerable to debt and did not need debt advice, to debt advice.What we're not seeing over 2021 is a huge spike yet in debt advice demand. So, I think we said last time I gave evidence to you, about COVID, that one of the oddities of COVID was that debt advice demand actually dropped, for a number of reasons that we understand better now than we did then. We have seen a steady increase in debt advice demand over 2022, and certainly in early January this year we've had some high numbers. So, we had days in January that were higher than any day last year in client demand.So, we're not yet seeing the explosive increase in client demand that we saw, for instance, in 2008-09 following that recession, but, typically, there is a lag between people falling into difficulty and seeking debt advice. So, about half our clients say that they've been struggling with their debts and worrying about their finances for a year or more before seeking debt advice. There are a number of barriers to people seeking help, and there are a number of ways that people try and manage their financial difficulties before coming to debt advice, most worryingly by juggling bills and borrowing, which can make the harm of debt worse when they actually do come to debt advice in the end.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you for that comprehensive reply. I don't want you to repeat the same information, but I think what it would be useful to know is really what impact it's having on debt levels, because, as Mr Tutton said, if people are borrowing money, then we're into a very dangerous situation that it's very difficult to emerge from. Steffan, do you want to go first?\n\nDr Steffan Evans: Yes, thanks. So, we've got some brand new data I can share with you today. So, the reason we didn't share written evidence was that we had a poll go to the field two weeks ago today, with YouGov. So, we had the results through last Friday, and we're launching the report on Thursday, so we'll share a written copy with you once that's written up. But I've taken the time to go through the data on debt, and what we're seeing maybe feeds into what Peter was saying there that the headline levels of debt, actually, seem pretty stable in terms of the proportion of people who are reporting back they're in debt. So, this is the third survey in a row. So, there was one towards the tail end of 2021, one in summer 2022, and then this one where, in terms of the proportion of people saying that they're in debt, it hasn't really changed much in our survey. So, 13 per cent of people were saying that they were in more than one month\u2019s worth of arrears, and 28 per cent of people were saying that they'd borrowed money over the last three months to manage the cost of living. So, that does suggest maybe that those extra payments we've seen, that extra support, has stabilised in terms of the sheer number of people. But, of course, what that doesn't tell us is that, for those in debt, has the nature of that debt changed. Have they gone deeper into debt, et cetera?What we do know from it and what we've been breaking down is that there are groups that are at far, far greater risk of living in debt\u2014many of the ones that Peter\u2019s already mentioned. I think one that really jumped out at me was that over half of people on universal credit borrowed money at some point in the last three months. That was one of the things that came out of the survey. And, interestingly, 10 per cent of people on universal credit reported that they\u2019d had a loan from the Government\u2014so, a kind of budget advance, or something like that. They're quite unique in terms of that being a source of debt as well. Although, of course, friends and family, credit cards, et cetera, are bigger sources. In terms of the other groups, renters and disabled people feature very, very prominently, and households with children. And we definitely do see a skewing towards younger working adults. So, adults under 50 seem to be more likely, in our survey responses, to report that they've either fallen behind on a bill, or that they've borrowed money, than adults over 50. So, that's kind of a headline finding.Carers as well are a group that we've got some data on for the first time, and, again, they seem to be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a group that's more likely to fall into debt. So, that link between groups that were most likely to live in poverty, most likely to struggle with debt before, are absolutely the groups of people where we're seeing huge proportions of them reporting that they're in debt.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. We'll come back to the detail on this in a moment. So, the Citizens Advice graph, which tells more than 1,000 words, really highlights the impact of the removal of some of the Welsh Government support. So, I wondered if you could just briefly summarise how you think that is going to impact on the sort of work your organisation is doing, Luke Young.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Young: Of course, Chair. As Members will have seen the graph, which does tell the story, we are in a situation where the choices that the Welsh Government made last winter and this winter have better protected people in Wales this winter. The UK Government and Welsh Government support have helped a large group of people with direct funding and direct payments over the last few months. For lots of those groups who were eligible, that has kept them afloat this winter. We're now looking, though, at a situation where the Wales fuel support scheme will not be in the next budget, and UK Government support will reduce alongside the energy guarantee, alongside rising prices.&nbsp;And so, what our modelling shows is that we see rising expenses on households and not enough income to cover it. One of the key things we've seen in the last year, just to add to the conversation around debt, is that the average energy debt for Citizens Advice clients in Wales rose last year from \u00a31,114 to \u00a31,419. Now, some of that extra pressure on those particular households will have been covered by Government support, but, with everything else, as both my colleagues have said, things are going in the wrong direction. And so, we worry that, in a few months' time, we will be seeing lots more people for crisis debt support. &nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Can I bring in Jane Dodds, who wanted to follow up?\n\nJane Dodds MS: Yes, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the graph. You talked about the Citizens Advice graph in the report. One of the things that I wanted to talk about is the fact that it appears that the council tax arrears\u2014so, the amount that people pay in council tax\u2014is the highest increase. And I was interested in hearing more about exactly how it works with local authorities, because I understood that they weren't putting pressure on people who are in arrears with regard to their council tax.&nbsp;So, could you just take us through that graph a little bit, please, if that's okay, Chair?\n\n"}

May I ask therefore whether Members would be content for Huw Irranca-Davies to be appointed as temporary chair for the second part of today's meeting? I see that everyone is content with that. Great. Thank you very much. And I do believe that it is just worth explaining that, if I have any technical issues today, I'm sure that Huw will be able to step into the breach if I disappear from your screens, or whatever else could happen as we use the technology today. There we are. Excellent. Thank you very much to you all.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Right, we'll move on to the second item, which is the continuation of our evidence gathering on and scrutiny of the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill. And joining us today, we have three individuals who are going to give evidence to us. A very warm welcome, therefore, to Chris Ashley, who's policy lead, environment and vehicles with the Road Haulage Association; Christine Boston, who's director of Sustrans Cymru; and Joshua James, who's the public affairs manager at Living Streets. A very warm welcome to the three of you. We'll go straight to questions, therefore, and I'll ask the opening question, a general question, if truth to be told: is the Bill as it's currently drafted sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in the air quality and soundscapes in Wales? And if it isn't sufficiently ambitious, could you explain why? Who wants to go first?\n\nChristine Boston: I'm happy to go first.&nbsp;\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, Christine\u2014okay, thank you very much.\n\nChristine Boston: Diolch. So, in our view, we think the Bill needs to be more ambitious, given the scale of the problem. It's quite a major issue that needs to be tackled, and we know that transport is a major contributor to poor air quality. It's the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, and road traffic is a major source of carbon emissions as well.&nbsp;For us in particular we're disappointed that there isn't a greater focus on active travel as part of the solution. We think there are some opportunities to build that into the Act. And the other thing is we would like it to be better aligned to World Health Organization guidance. They have quite stringent international targets and the Bill doesn't quite align with those at the moment, so we'd like to see that.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And a few of those issues, obviously, we'll be picking up directly on as we pick up on these issues. Any further comments from Josh or Chris? Josh.\n\nJoshua James: First of all, I would agree with what Christine Boston has said. In some parts of the Bill there is clear ambition, and we welcome the wider range of powers\u2014for instance, things on trunk road charging et cetera. But, particularly in terms of air quality targets, we don't think there's enough ambition stated to deal with the\u2014. Well, we're dealing with a climate emergency, we're dealing with an air quality emergency, and we feel like it could go further.&nbsp;\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay, thank you. And Chris, your reflections.&nbsp;\n\nChris Ashley: Yes, good morning, everybody. So, there's no dispute from the Road Haulage Association on what's here in terms of the air quality and its ambition. We agree broadly with the spirit of what we're trying to achieve here. No-one's disagreeing. Everyone agrees with the need to improve the environment. We do think, though, a different approach is needed, and we'll probably come on to that later in this session. We have particular concern about the needs of small businesses, and how they are supported through any transition to invest in the environment. Issues about the air quality\u2014we have no issue about the air quality targets per se, although we do think they are going to need to be staged in order to make this achievable. We do have concerns, though, about the use of clean air zones, but we'll probably cover that later on in this session.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Indeed. Okay, that's a great overview from the three of you. Thank you for that, and, as you say, Chris, we will be picking up on some of these discrete issues as we proceed. So, Huw, I'll hand over to you.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair; good morning, everybody. I wonder\u2014. I'm going to turn to the issues of air quality targets in a moment and dwell on them for a little while and get into some of the detail. But, Chair, I didn't mention at the start, because I'm never quite sure to what extent we need to declare it\u2014so, I'm chair of the active travel group and I'm chair also of the air quality cross-party group that's done so much work, both of them. But, actually, there are several members on our committee who are also members of that.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: And all of that is already a matter public record, but there's no harm\u2014\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Indeed. And the reason I just wanted to lay that out is because I've got a question for both Christine and Joshua. You may have seen the evidence sessions last week\u2014. Before I go on to air quality targets, you may have seen the evidence sessions last week where I asked the witnesses whether they had a view on whether they'd want to see strengthening of some of the unfinished business of the active travel duties, for example, a duty to promote on all public bodies incorporated within this, on the basis\u2014I won't rehearse the whole argument, but on the basis\u2014that there is a legal argument to be settled on whether it would fall within the scope of this, the purpose of this Bill and its connected purposes. Do you have a view from Sustrans and Living Streets as to whether you'd want to see that incorporated within this Bill as it goes through? Or do you think it's unnecessary? Let me go to Joshua first, there, if I can.&nbsp;\n\nJoshua James: Yes, absolutely. From our perspective, it's directly connected. We know that the answer to improving air quality, from the various studies from around Europe and here in the UK and in Wales\u2014they suggest that the best way to improve our air quality is modal shift away from private vehicles. Private vehicles make up the greatest contributor to air pollution, and reducing that through modal shift to active travel is possibly the best solution. So, it is directly connected to the aim of this Bill. As Christine said earlier, we would like to see more focus on active travel. It is the solution to air pollution and to cleaner air. So, yes\u2014in answer to your question, Huw, yes.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Josh. And Christine.\n\nChristine Boston: Yes, I support that too. I think there needs to be greater awareness of the public health impacts of car use and particular encouragement to give people the confidence to get out of the car, especially for short journeys. We know that the active travel Act could be strengthened in that way, and so if this is an opportunity to do that and to create a more robust legislative framework that allows for promotion, then we certainly support that.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay. Thank you both. Chris, I haven't left you out; I'll come back to you in a moment on air quality targets, and, if you want to add to anything you've just heard, please feel free there. But I wonder if you have, Josh and Christine, anything that your people could share with the committee on that, and particularly on the issue of whether it falls within the scope of this Bill as well, because that's the practical obstacle, the paramount obstacle. Let me turn, then, to air quality. Thank you for those answers. Let me turn to air quality. Again, for Sustrans and Living Streets, other than PM2.5, the Bill doesn't require Welsh Government to set targets for other pollutants or to prescribe the pollutants for which targets should be set. Could I have your views on this and also on the three-year timescale for setting the PM2.5 target? Who'd like to go first? Christine.&nbsp;\n\nChristine Boston: I can certainly go first. This is a very serious and urgent problem. We know that between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths a day are caused by the effects of air pollution\u2014they're Public Health Wales figures\u2014and those deaths are preventable. So, Ministers should be able\u2014. Well, they should be setting ambitious targets for all pollutants, and the targets ought to be in line with World Health Organization guidelines, and, as a matter of urgency, three years is too long to wait to do that. So, yes. We know that it will be a challenge for authorities to meet those targets, but they need to be set as a matter of urgency, and we need to start developing plans so that people can breathe clean air.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thanks, Christine. I'll come to Josh, and then I'll come to you, Chris, as well. Josh.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nJoshua James: Yes, absolutely. Particulate matter is important, but there are other classes of particulate matter that have a huge impact on public health. Diesel particulate matter is one\u2014so, diesel particulate matter, more than 90 per cent of which is less than 1 in diameter, compared to the 2.5, so that's a whole new class\u2014and that is some of the most dangerous in terms of its impact on public health. Since 2010, in the number of private vehicles that have been sold in the UK, diesel powered vehicles outstripped petrol for the first time, and diesel vehicles produce around 22 times more particulate matter and four times more nitrogen oxide than petrol vehicles. So, we are facing, in some senses, a worsening situation, and it will be important for us, in order to have the right solutions to the challenges we face, to know and have targets for each individual particulate matter\u2014so, diesel particulate matter PM10, which, although is not seen as dangerous in the long term as particulate matter 2.5, does contribute to worsening conditions and respiratory conditions. So, having targets for all of these groups, classes, of particulate matter will be important in making sure that we have the right policy solutions as well.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thanks very much. Chris, I'm going to come to you now and give you the floor on the questions I asked before, if you want to touch on them as well, but particularly on this issue of targets. And I wonder as well, Chris, if you'd touch on some of the evidence that you've given in writing from the Road Haulage Association about the consideration of economic well-being when setting targets. Okay, over to you.\n\n"}

May I ask therefore whether Members would be content for Huw Irranca-Davies to be appointed as temporary chair for the second part of today's meeting? I see that everyone is content with that. Great. Thank you very much. And I do believe that it is just worth explaining that, if I have any technical issues today, I'm sure that Huw will be able to step into the breach if I disappear from your screens, or whatever else could happen as we use the technology today. There we are. Excellent. Thank you very much to you all.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Right, we'll move on to the second item, which is the continuation of our evidence gathering on and scrutiny of the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill. And joining us today, we have three individuals who are going to give evidence to us. A very warm welcome, therefore, to Chris Ashley, who's policy lead, environment and vehicles with the Road Haulage Association; Christine Boston, who's director of Sustrans Cymru; and Joshua James, who's the public affairs manager at Living Streets. A very warm welcome to the three of you. We'll go straight to questions, therefore, and I'll ask the opening question, a general question, if truth to be told: is the Bill as it's currently drafted sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in the air quality and soundscapes in Wales? And if it isn't sufficiently ambitious, could you explain why? Who wants to go first?\n\nChristine Boston: I'm happy to go first.&nbsp;\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, Christine\u2014okay, thank you very much.\n\nChristine Boston: Diolch. So, in our view, we think the Bill needs to be more ambitious, given the scale of the problem. It's quite a major issue that needs to be tackled, and we know that transport is a major contributor to poor air quality. It's the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, and road traffic is a major source of carbon emissions as well.&nbsp;For us in particular we're disappointed that there isn't a greater focus on active travel as part of the solution. We think there are some opportunities to build that into the Act. And the other thing is we would like it to be better aligned to World Health Organization guidance. They have quite stringent international targets and the Bill doesn't quite align with those at the moment, so we'd like to see that.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And a few of those issues, obviously, we'll be picking up directly on as we pick up on these issues. Any further comments from Josh or Chris? Josh.\n\nJoshua James: First of all, I would agree with what Christine Boston has said. In some parts of the Bill there is clear ambition, and we welcome the wider range of powers\u2014for instance, things on trunk road charging et cetera. But, particularly in terms of air quality targets, we don't think there's enough ambition stated to deal with the\u2014. Well, we're dealing with a climate emergency, we're dealing with an air quality emergency, and we feel like it could go further.&nbsp;\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay, thank you. And Chris, your reflections.&nbsp;\n\nChris Ashley: Yes, good morning, everybody. So, there's no dispute from the Road Haulage Association on what's here in terms of the air quality and its ambition. We agree broadly with the spirit of what we're trying to achieve here. No-one's disagreeing. Everyone agrees with the need to improve the environment. We do think, though, a different approach is needed, and we'll probably come on to that later in this session. We have particular concern about the needs of small businesses, and how they are supported through any transition to invest in the environment. Issues about the air quality\u2014we have no issue about the air quality targets per se, although we do think they are going to need to be staged in order to make this achievable. We do have concerns, though, about the use of clean air zones, but we'll probably cover that later on in this session.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Indeed. Okay, that's a great overview from the three of you. Thank you for that, and, as you say, Chris, we will be picking up on some of these discrete issues as we proceed. So, Huw, I'll hand over to you.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair; good morning, everybody. I wonder\u2014. I'm going to turn to the issues of air quality targets in a moment and dwell on them for a little while and get into some of the detail. But, Chair, I didn't mention at the start, because I'm never quite sure to what extent we need to declare it\u2014so, I'm chair of the active travel group and I'm chair also of the air quality cross-party group that's done so much work, both of them. But, actually, there are several members on our committee who are also members of that.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: And all of that is already a matter public record, but there's no harm\u2014\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Indeed. And the reason I just wanted to lay that out is because I've got a question for both Christine and Joshua. You may have seen the evidence sessions last week\u2014. Before I go on to air quality targets, you may have seen the evidence sessions last week where I asked the witnesses whether they had a view on whether they'd want to see strengthening of some of the unfinished business of the active travel duties, for example, a duty to promote on all public bodies incorporated within this, on the basis\u2014I won't rehearse the whole argument, but on the basis\u2014that there is a legal argument to be settled on whether it would fall within the scope of this, the purpose of this Bill and its connected purposes.

{"question": "What additional funding has been committed by the Welsh Government to support people arriving from Ukraine?", "evidence": "  1. Julie James AM states, \"We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales.\"   ", "options": ["A. \u00a310 million", "B. \u00a320 million", "C. \u00a330 million", "D. \u00a340 million"], "answer": "D", "content": "John Griffiths AM: Then we will move on to item 2, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our third evidence session, with the Minister for Climate Change, Julie James. Welcome, Minister, and welcome to your officials, Emma Williams, the director for housing and regeneration, and Dean Medcraft, director of finance and operations. Okay, Minister, we'd better move swiftly on. Let me begin, then, with a general question: to what extent has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 shaped the budget allocations within the climate change portfolio, and how has the Government's commitment to that Act been balanced with the need to address present-day cost-of-living and other pressures?\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Chair. There's no doubt at all that we're facing one of the most difficult and challenging budget settlements in Wales that we've ever faced as a result of choices made elsewhere. Inflation has also eroded our budget to worryingly low levels, and local authorities and NHS organisations are reporting significant shortfalls in funding as a result of the inflationary increases, the pay pressures, and, of course, the rising energy costs. So, there's no getting away from the fact that this has required us to make really, really difficult choices, and the UK Government has just failed to address the significant funding gap that should have uplifted our budgets in line with inflation in order to maintain the vital public services that we all rely on. So, the reality is that we could not meet all the pressures identified to support cost-of-living interventions within the funding available.But, despite that, we always maintain our approach rooted in the well-being of future generations Act, so we've undertaken to maximise the impact of the available resources that we do have, balancing our short-term needs with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and trying to make the longer term change and delivery that we want for our programme for government ambitions, including tackling poverty. This has resulted in the Government, across the Government, undertaking an exercise to review all of our budgets and prioritise our support where it was needed most, building on the actions that we already outlined as part of the spending review last year. I'm sure that the Chair is aware that the budget round this year has been supported by the work of the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee, which I'm a core member of.The result of that was that we put additional allocations into the discretionary assistance fund, homelessness services and the pupil development grant\u2014[<em>Interruption.</em>] Excuse me, Chair. The cost-of-living crisis and its impact on household budgets means that many people have been unable to pay their rent or other household bills, and, for my portfolio, the risk of them falling into rent arrears and subsequently facing eviction is a real, real concern. We do not want to push individuals towards seeking homelessness support from the local authority; we want them to go into homelessness prevention support, and we want to try to keep people in their homes where at all possible. I'm sure, Chair, that you'll remember from previous sessions with me, and I'm sure you've had evidence from elsewhere, that we continue to have very high levels of presentations for homelessness services right across Wales. So, I'm pleased to say that we have managed to find an additional allocation of \u00a310 million to put into the homelessness budget and to maintain our 'no-one left out' approach to be sure that no-one is forced to sleep rough. The additional funding is going to go into homelessness prevention measures, including where it cannot be prevented to meet the costs of temporary accommodation.I'm sure that the committee is also aware that we've had absolutely no funding commitment from the UK Government for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We funded our supersponsor scheme, including accommodation and wraparound support using funding from Welsh Government reserves, and we continue to support people arriving from Ukraine. We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales. We've committed \u00a320 million to supporting our Ukrainian humanitarian response as well, and that's to ensure that our really hard-pressed local authorities are able to continue offering the services that we've put in place.And then, Chair, I think what I really want the committee to understand is that, obviously, the part that you're looking at from my budget is part of a much bigger MEG, as we call it\u2014the main expenditure group. And so, we've had to look across right across the MEG to balance out how to get through the pain of this budget, and that's the word that has to be used. It's been a really, really, really difficult thing to do, and we've had to look at an enormous number of things that are essential to be able to push our progressive plans forward.So, we continue to outline a vision and our short and medium-term plans, including preventative plans, to push forward the reform. So, we continue, for example, to resource putting our homelessness legislation onto the statute book; we continue to look at embedding the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ways of working across the piece, including transparency and impact reform; we also continue to try to maintain the longer term strategies that we have for things like decarbonisation, for retrofit, and so on, balanced with the real sharp-point crisis that we've been facing and trying to move the money around, so that we're both helping people in the here and now, but also not making it worse for people later on because we've moved that money around. There's no getting away from the fact that it's been a real, real challenge to do so, and, as I say, we've had to look right across the whole expenditure group to do that, and the money has been moved accordingly in an attempt to do that. I'll leave it there. I'm sure that you'll get into some of the specifics, but I want the committee to fully understand the sheer scale of the budget process that we've been going through in order to try and squeeze some of this cost-of-living money out of the budget.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Okay, Minister. Thank you very much for that overview and, as you say, we'll be coming on to many of those matters with subsequent questions. Firstly, Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister and members of your office. May I apologise that I can't be there in person? I have personal reasons that mean that I am stuck here in north Wales at the moment. Minister, you mentioned in your opening statement about homelessness. Just in general on that point, do you feel that homelessness services and support services for homelessness are being prioritised in this budget?\n\nJulie James AM: Diolch, Mabon. Yes, absolutely. So, the data shows clearly that demand is increasing. I've just said in my opening remarks that we know that the pressure on homelessness services across Wales hasn't abated and, in some places, has actually increased. We also know that the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing are adding to the drivers that drive people into home loss. We also know that prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address homelessness. So, we're not going to row back on our 'no-one left out' policy, despite the real serious pressures that we've facing. So, recognising those pressures, the prevention budget will increase by \u00a350 million in 2023-24, an additional \u00a310 million more than previously planned, and that takes our investment in homelessness and housing support to over \u00a3207 million next year.&nbsp;In recognition of the support services required to keep people in their homes as well, we increased the housing support grant budget by \u00a340 million in 2021-22 to \u00a3166.763 million, which is a 30 per cent rise. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the incredibly difficult budget pressure that we've had this year\u2014and it has been incredibly difficult\u2014we have managed to maintain that substantial increase in this year's budget, and then going forward into the 2023-24 budget. So, the answer, I suppose, in a nutshell is that there is obviously more that we could do; there's always going to be more we can do in the face of the current cost-of-living pressure. But, I'm very pleased that we've managed to maintain services at the increased level that we were able to put them in, and we've just managed to get another \u00a310 million into homelessness services themselves. We continue to scrutinise the budget every day, I assure you, looking for extra ways to increase money into this essential service.&nbsp;\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Minister, for that response. If I may go to the narrative of the draft budget as I read it and as we saw it back in December, in that narrative, it mentions the effect of low pay and cost of living on the front-line staff of homelessness services. There was an example that 44 per cent of the workforce were unable to pay bills, that 11 per cent of them were unable to pay rent, et cetera. But, this, again, this year, is a flat settlement, compared to\u2014. I accept that you say that you've increased it in previous years, but in the last year, we've seen huge inflation, so this settlement, which is flat, is a real-terms cut in the settlement, which means that we will then see more of the front-line workforce leaving their jobs, and then more pressure on services. So, in considering the targets that we have\u2014you've mentioned some of them\u2014and the fact that we're likely to see more of that workforce leave and unable to do their work, and additional pressure, do you feel that this settlement is fair for that sector in particular?&nbsp;And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you\u2019re putting towards these services that are provided is enough? [Translation should read: And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you're providing is able to go towards these services that are provided by front-line staff?]&nbsp;\n\n"}

I'd like to welcome and introduce our witnesses who've joined us this morning. We have Sarah Thomas, director, The Fostering Network Wales, Elizabeth Bryan, head of operations, The Fostering Network Wales, Matt Lewis, therapeutic fostering services manager Wales, Action for Children, Rhian Carter, team manager, Action for Children, and Mike Anthony, manager for TACT Cymru. You're all very welcome.Members have a number of questions to put to you this morning. I realise there's lots to say, but if somebody has said something, I'd encourage you not to repeat it because I just want to make sure everybody gets through questions. I'd like to remind Members to perhaps be as brief as possible in their questioning. So, we'll start off with questions from Buffy Williams. Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you for joining us this morning. How would you describe the situation of foster placements in Wales? For example, are enough of the right types of placements in the right geographical locations?\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Who wants to start?&nbsp;\n\nSarah Thomas: I'll start.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Thank you, Sarah.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Thomas: I'd say that we do not have enough placements, full stop. We do not have a foster carer for every child who needs them, and they're certainly not living in the location that the child needs them to live in. Some of the barriers that we have to placing children locally is the way that we have a current marketplace, which means that foster carers are free to foster with whom they choose, and that's a very good thing for lots of foster carers, but if we don't utilise and access them in the same way that a local authority can access their foster carers, then we prevent children from being placed within their own locality. The children who are most likely to remain in school, to remain able to attend their clubs and activities and to have a thriving opportunity are the ones who have a foster placement as close to their home location as possible, when it's safe to do so. Local authorities will know all of their foster carers within their LA, and they need to improve, I believe, in the way that they utilise each other and also the systems that are in place to utilise those providers who are external and may have a foster carer right on the front door of where that child needs it, but they can't access it as easily because of the systems and structures we have in place.&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Is there anybody else? Matt.&nbsp;\n\nMatt Lewis: No, we certainly don't echo Sarah's point on that. My view is that we will never have enough suitable families for the number of children because of the framework we're working under, which is actually part of the problem at the moment. So, I think, in terms of radical reform, it's urgently needed of the entire system. Fostering for the foster parents is really complex and challenging. They lack support. They're under a huge amount of scrutiny from the child protection framework and the regulations. So, it is a very difficult place at the moment.&nbsp;The other problem we have is that the poverty, the trauma in our communities, is very serious. The children who come in from the referrals to our service are the worst we've ever seen. Children are routinely not being fed, starved, dehydrated, locked in cupboards, with serious sexual abuse. So, these children need support in their communities to stop the flow-through into care, and the foster families need a different type of recognition and different frameworks for support.\n\nMike Anthony: I'd also add as well that, in some ways, we've always had that problem, and, ever since I've been in social work and fostering, we've had problems recruiting foster carers. But I think it's even worse now, exacerbated by things post pandemic. The sorts of people that we are looking for, traditionally, are people who've got a spare room\u2014financial, cost-of-living crisis, all those things have come together as well. So, we're actually losing some of the people that we would've traditionally perhaps been able to access as well, so there are additional pressures. And we're also finding single foster carers are struggling within the current climate as well, because it is one of those roles that people have to make a big decision about, whether they can afford to foster, and the climate at the moment is super challenging.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Buffy.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you. Can you tell us about the main challenges facing fostering in Wales at the moment, and what are the key priorities to address them?\n\nSarah Thomas: Yes, go for it.\n\nMatt Lewis: The main challenges are that the children are coming in with undiagnosed but very recognisable lifelong conditions such as complex post-traumatic stress, which is created by the birth family members who have terrorised their children and severely hurt the children. They're also severely neglected, and that neglect creates a lifelong learning difficulty. So, the kind of expectations are that these children will develop mental progress if you put them in the right place that's alongside other children, and the fact of the matter is, simply, the outcomes tell us that that's not true. I think of our service\u2014people who've been doing it a long time\u2014and we do everything we can to support the children, but managing their environments and keeping it safe, calm, playful, taking them back to early years experience, and keeping the anxiety at bay is the best chance that we have to help them.We also think much more like an adoptive service than a fostering service. So, success for us is that our children stay with our families for the rest of their lives; they're not encouraged to move out when they're 16, as they currently are. We know that children leaving care at 16 or 18 are likely to have their own children and then begins the cycle again, which leads to more potential removals of children. So, fostering should be viewed as a permanent option. It should be a family like any other. We don't use the word 'placement', because the children get very confused by it. So, there's a huge amount of challenge, but that would be where I would start at the moment\u2014recognising that children need far more support across a life journey than they're currently getting.\n\nSarah Thomas: I think I would add, on that note, really, stability is the greatest challenge that we face for our young people. We are currently unable to ensure that, when we remove them from their family, where we take away the people who were meant to fight for them and protect them\u2014. We do that and then we fail to offer an alternative that is better than that on lots of occasions, because we're unable to create that permanency, to ensure the best possible match, because of the lack of provision that we have within the fostering sector. And then, on top of that, we don't necessarily structure our services in the way that they are driven to meet the needs of the child. At the moment, our services are meeting the needs of those who work within them, or meeting the financial pressures, rather than focusing on\u2014. It feels to me like we've sort of lost track of what good outcomes are and what it is that we're all here to do, and what we're striving to achieve seems to have become slightly diluted in the fact that our services aren't able to do what many of them would like to do.\n\nMike Anthony: And I think some of that has been impacted hugely by the social work crisis as well in staffing. We're dealing with many foster placements where the turnover of social workers\u2014. There are massive delays, as Matt was describing, and a complexity of what we're dealing with with the needs of the children, and there's a real inconsistency quite often, or changes in social workers, and some of the teams are running at 30 per cent social work and carrying vacancies or agency staff. One of the good things about being in fostering, as an agency for a long time, as well, is that there's continuity in our fostering teams, but in the social work teams the churn is enormous, and that has massive implications for the services that you get. Delays in therapy: we might have a referral going to therapy, the social worker changes, the team leader changes, and you're knocked back in the work that's going on. So, I think the current crisis in social work is enormous as well.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth Bryan: Yes, for the child to have an adult who knows them well making a decision for them, I think some of them probably feel that that isn't the case because there hasn't been a consistency for them. And then, when they make their own decisions\u2014. I think we spoke earlier this morning in our event about how they're expected to make a lot of big decisions by themselves when they're 18, but they've not been supported to do that; it's not scaffolded through their life because there isn't that consistency from a trusted adult. I think that's really key.\n\nMike Anthony: I think it actually does the opposite as well, doesn't it? In some cases, it's actually teaching some of our children and young people not to trust or invest in some of the adults that are working with them. So, it's a by-product of that, which is absolutely the opposite of what we're trying to achieve.\n\nRhian Carter: We also find there's poor provision. So, a lot of our children struggle in mainstream school, and even the specialist provisions are not fit for what the children need. In terms of the trauma, we find the children just can't cope with an education environment, and they really, really struggle. Family contact is also a huge issue. You're sending a child to see their abuser. So, it often retraumatises the children, and the lead-up to contact and after contact can be horrendous for our children in terms of bed-wetting, soiling. It sends them backwards, really, so they're not able to have that safe time away from their perpetrators.\n\nMatt Lewis: Rhian's right. There are two things that we've identified that break down long-term foster families, and that is the wrong education provision because the children simply do not function at their chronological age in the way that mainstream education thinks they do. So, at 18, the children are much more like four years of age in the emotional developmental stage\u2014they still can't do friendships, can't manage relationships, or money, for example. The other thing is that the children have been highly terrorised and traumatised by birth families, and when we show them the perpetrators of their abuse, our current framework suggests that that's a good thing, but if you look at the underlying neurological, psychological impact on the child, it pulls them back into that abusive system. So, we create on our own\u2014. We've got a clinical issue in terms of the way in which the brain is affected by neurology that isn't recognised by the welfare and the rights-based system that we currently work within.\n\nRhian Carter: And also life story work. Children often have this piece of work done, often sharing information they never knew about or can't remember, and then they're planting memories and stories into their brains that they just cannot cope with\u2014\n\nMatt Lewis: They can't process it.\n\nRhian Carter: \u2014and they just can't process.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Just one more quick question, Chair\u2014\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Yes, absolutely.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: \u2014maybe to Matt. You spoke about children who have been seriously sexually abused, exploited and terrorised. Is there enough expert care\u2014quality expert care\u2014out there to support these children within the care sector?\n\nMatt Lewis: I think, unfortunately\u2014. I've been working in these services a long time\u2014youth justice Merthyr and children with disabilities. There's a kind of myth\u2014a hopeful myth\u2014of recovery; we kind of hope that people will get better. Now, we know, as adults, if any of us have had some difficulty, we're always managing that difficulty. But, what we've got with our children are very, very serious developmental issues and traumatic problems that the system currently doesn't recognise; it's not making connections between them as victims of very serious perpetrators and what that means for lifelong belonging, if that's the only family you're allowed to belong in. I don't think the current system thinks clinically deep enough about the state in which children come out of what are very dangerous family settings. So, the short answer is 'no', unfortunately. There's simply not enough expertise.\n\nMike Anthony: I think, even when there is the expertise, sometimes you're trying to get to that, and sometimes the waiting lists are so long in child and adolescent mental health services. It's a pretty broken system, I think. That's why sometimes, like in our own lives, we have to sometimes bypass that, and parents will look to get their own services bought in or whatever. I think, with placements, sometimes, we're seeing placements break down, and not just placements break down, but we're seeing foster carers dealing with highly traumatised children, not getting the services the children need, and then we're seeing breakdowns in placements and losing foster carers because it can be such a difficult and impactful experience, managing such traumatised children.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Thanks, Buffy. A question now from James Evans. James.&nbsp;\n\nJames Evans MS: You're never quite sure here who's going to mute you or unmute you, sometimes. I am looking at my other screen, I am Chair, because I can't look at the small screen, my eyes go funny. Thank you.&nbsp;We've heard of the huge disruption and upset that children and young people experience when they have to move from placement to placement, especially at short notice, after the trauma of being removed from their birth family. Statistics do show that more than a quarter of children have had two or more placements in the last 12 months alone. Why are there so many placement moves and, to what extent is this because of a child's own needs, as opposed to it being because the placement is needed for another child coming into the system? I can't see any of you, so you'll have to jump in as and when. Chair, I'll have to hand over to you to bring people in, because I can't see you.&nbsp;\n\nJayne Bryant AM: That's no problem. Who wants to start. Sian? Sarah?\n\n"}

I'd like to welcome the Minister for Health and Social Services this morning and her officials. So, perhaps, if I ask officials to introduce themselves for the public record.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMari Williams: Mari Williams, Welsh Government legal services health team.&nbsp;\n\nLeanne Roberts: Morning. I'm Leanne Roberts. I'm the policy lead for healthcare procurement reform.&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Eluned Morgan, health and social services Minister for Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nDafydd Evans: Dafydd Evans, senior responsible officer for the Bill.&nbsp;\n\nNick Lambert: Nick Lambert, Welsh Government legal services, Treasury team.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you very much. Welcome back to some of the panel, who were with us for a technical briefing. We appreciate that, Minister. That was very helpful in our early discussions of the scrutiny process. So, thank you for that. Perhaps I'll ask the Minister: what does the Government want to achieve from this Bill? What's the Government seeking to achieve?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: In order to answer that, if you don't mind, I'll just give a little bit of a background to how we came here, because it is a little bit complicated, and this is not the most exciting Bill you will have had in front of you as a committee. So, what happened is, after we left the European Union, the UK Government said, 'Look, we'll do things differently when it comes to procurement.' And the health team in the UK Government said, 'Oh, well, you know what? We might want to carve ourselves out of whatever you're going to do with the rest of the economy. We want something specific for health, and we want to do things differently for health.' And, as it happens, there was the Health and Care Act 2022 that was going through Parliament. They, therefore, effectively, have written something so that they can have a separate selection regime, so a separate procurement approach from the rest of the economy.Now, because health is devolved, that was effectively an English-only Bill, so they just cracked on with that and didn't actually think about the implications for us, and obviously we live cheek by jowl with the English NHS. They have a huge market, we have 3 million people that we have to service. So, suddenly, we're in a situation where we're going to find ourselves in a different procurement place from England, and there are potential implications for that. So, what we're doing here is we're plugging a gap that has been created by some of the actions that have happened in England, and allowing us the opportunity, should we wish, to align ourselves to the new health procurement regime in England. Now, the problem is they're still going through that process at the moment, so we're not quite sure where it's going to land, in terms of what's going to be covered, but what we want through this Bill is the opportunity and the ability to be able to align, should we wish to do so. I hope that's given a little bit of a background, because it's quite technical, but that's a little bit of the background.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Can I come in straight away, just with a little supplementary? You said that you want to give yourselves an opportunity, as a Government, to align with changes in England. Do you see it exclusively in that way? Or do you see this also as an opportunity to differentiate yourself and head in a different direction, if you so wish, if you're not happy with what you're seeing developing in England?&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, that's an opportunity as well. We're going to have to see what they do and whether we want to follow that. At the moment, we don't know what they're going to put in, so what we didn't want to do was just say, 'Chuck us in that Bill', because we don't know what they're going to come up with. But this will give us the opportunity to follow or not follow, as we see fit.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Okay, thank you.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: What do you see, Minister, as\u2014? What's your vision, I suppose, for health procurement in Wales?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think what's important is to understand that procurement in itself is not what we're about. We're about delivering our vision, which has been set out in 'A Healthier Wales', and what we need in terms of procurement is a system that will enable us to deliver the vision that we've got. What we have been advocating for a while is, perhaps, more collaborative working, making sure we've got high-quality services that are delivered efficiently, that are focused on patient outcomes, but making sure we also have the right checks and balances, which ensures that we spend the little money that we have efficiently on services.\n\nRussell George AM: Quite rightfully, Minister, you talk about patient outcomes, and you said earlier this isn't the most exciting Bill, as well. What would be your advice if I was to get back home this afternoon and a constituent said to me, 'What have you been doing?' I'd say, 'Well, I've been scrutinising this Bill.' How would you explain to your constituent, for example, how this Bill is going to make the health service better for them or the outcomes better for them?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I guess until we see the regulations, it's difficult to say, so let's remember this is what they call a framework Bill. It gives us a holding place where we can then make regulations underneath that, so it gives us the authority and the ability to make rules in future\u2014\n\nRussell George AM: Can you give us an example, perhaps?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Okay. I think what's clear is that there are examples of where there may be barriers to entry for, perhaps, smaller providers, because the procurement rules at the moment could be quite onerous, could be quite high in terms of administrative need. What this will give us an opportunity to do, for example\u2014at the moment, the default position is that everything's got to go through procurement\u2014what this will do for us in future is allow us, for example, the opportunity to roll over contracts that exist already. If they're being well serviced, if we're getting efficiency from the system, we could roll over those contracts. So, that's one thing. It's very difficult to do that now; we have to go through the whole onerous activity. And if, for example, we could see that there was only the possibility of one tender coming up, then we could, perhaps, look at a direct contract being awarded. And then, of course, competition is the third factor. But, at the moment, it's just assumed everything goes out to competition. So, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in future that should save, or could potentially save on some administrative work. I don't know if Dafydd would like to expand on that.\n\nDafydd Evans: Thank you, Minister. We've heard from a number of places that there are things that would want to be looked at through the regulations, so, exploring some of the things. But, currently, because of the way that procurement is done, and it's quite formal through that tendering\u2014. People have talked to us about wanting to explore things like clusters, so where a health board may work with GPs and others in the third sector to come together to collaboratively put that best service together, perhaps, for communities. So, by having a process that is more collaborative, as the Minister's described, rather than it starting with formal procurement, there may be examples there where you could look at services slightly differently and bring a collaboration together to give those better services. So, those are the things we'd want to explore, I think, through the regulations and through consultation. But a Bill that is competition last, which is what this is, a provider selector regime, rather than competition first, which is what the default the Minister has described is, gives you that opportunity. We won't be able to explore those as well without.&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think the other thing is the third sector. There are real opportunities for the third sector here, as well. That's something I'm particularly interested in.\n\nRussell George AM: I think what Dafydd has outlined, and yourself, is what we've heard ourselves in the earlier evidence sessions. So, certainly, we've had that view from some stakeholders that it's a complex landscape at the moment in terms of commissioning. Minister, are you happy, and your officials as well, with the level of engagement that you've had with the UK Government?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think it's fair to say that in the early days it wasn't great. They were just cracking on with this Health and Care Act and the provider selector regime development, and hadn't really thought about the impact it would have on us. So, after I wrote to the Minister, we have had better engagement. We have seen, for example, an early draft of their regulations, but we haven't got the final draft yet, so what I am hoping\u2014. Things have definitely improved and they've agreed to liaise with our officials on cross-border arrangements as part of developing their guidelines. So, it's certainly improved, but it wasn't great at the beginning, I think it's fair to say.\n\nRussell George AM: Have you had any opportunity at all to feed into the UK Government's policy development in regard to the PSR?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Not really, and not early on. I think it's just kind of having a look at what's coming our way, because obviously, we don't have to follow everything that they're doing; health is devolved. So, once we know what they're doing, we can make a judgment then as to whether we want to follow it or not.\n\nRussell George AM: Okay. Thank you. Jack.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thanks, Chair. Good morning, Minister. We've heard the same from officials and other evidence sessions that we hold. I'm just trying to gauge the risk of absolutely not doing this and how real that risk is.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, I think, what we've had as a response from the people we've consulted with, so the people who commission, is a very clear, 'We want to align', okay? So, that's the line they've heard from us. So, there may be examples\u2014. So, at the moment, for example, if you look at some very complex mental health support, we currently commission some of that from England, and what we don't want is a situation where those organisations in England that are providing a service to us now, for what is quite a small market\u2014because you can imagine, we're not talking about a lot of people\u2014they might just say, 'That's a completely different procurement regime. We're not playing; it's just too much trouble for us.' So, that's the danger is that we lose some of those services that exist at the moment. That's one of the dangers, anyway.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: That's a good example as well.\n\nRussell George AM: Gareth and then Rhun. Gareth.\n\nGareth Davies MS: Thanks, Chair. I just want to ask on maybe a technical level; we see a lot of LCMs going through the Senedd that are replications of or passages of UK legislation that comes to the Senedd, so, in that sense, if we're taking a lot of the elements of the Health and Care Act from the UK, why was that not an LCM, and why is it a procurement Bill? Is that the will of UK Ministers to have something different in Wales, or is that the will of the Welsh Government to say, 'We want to take different elements and make our own Bill', as a consequence of the Health and Care Act going through the UK? I appreciate it's quite a layman's question, but just on a technical level, I'd just like to know.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, had we gone down the LCM route and asked them to put us under the Health and Care Act, then we wouldn't have had any possibility of diverging from whatever they're going to come up with. And at the moment, what we're talking about is a framework Bill and the interesting bit of this legislation will come when we're looking at the regulations. So, what is it that's captured in the regulations? And until we see that, it's difficult for us to assess whether we want to align or not. So, we need the flexibility through this very short Bill that we're bringing through here to allow us to either copy or to say, 'Well, we'll take most of it, but there may be some areas where we don't want to play the same way you're playing in England.' So, that's why we didn't go down the LCM route.\n\nRussell George AM: Rhun.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: I want to go back to the response to Jack's question. I understand in principle why officials would be afraid that service providers could decide that they don't want to provide services to Wales again. That would raise concerns about losing services. But to what extent have you been able to prove that that would happen, by speaking to providers who say, 'Do you know what? We don't foresee that we would want to be part of a health regime in Wales if there was a different procurement regime'?&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Dafydd, do you want to come in here?\n\nDafydd Evans: So, most of the conversations we've had in the informal engagement so far have been with the NHS and specifically with the people in the NHS who manage all of the procurement and all of these relationships with the providers. So, I think it's their operational advice in the way that they currently manage these that\u2014. They know that there are already tensions sometimes in being able to get services even under the current level playing field, because, as the Minister said, we're a small\u2014we're sometimes a small market. So, we had a very clear message from the procurement experts in the NHS that, if you change the level of the playing field again\u2014. There were some services, which we talked about last time\u2014renal services, mental health services\u2014where they're saying there's a very real risk of this.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: It would be very useful to us as a committee if we were able to have this\u2014even if it's unattributed, even if it's fairly confidential\u2014so that we can understand better those actual concerns that arise from actual contracts that are currently held between the NHS and providers, if that might be available.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I guess it's their information to give, so\u2014\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Indeed.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: \u2014we'll have to ask them whether they\u2014. But you could ask them that directly, couldn't you, as a committee?&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: We'll do that.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Our hope is that you already have it, that you could pass it on.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes, I mean that's part of the consultation\u2014that's what has been fed back to us.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. That's a good suggestion. Jenny, I want to come to you, but then do you want to come on to your set of questions after you ask your supplementary?\n\n"}

And let me welcome our witnesses joining us in person today. From the left, as I look at our witnesses, we have&nbsp;Gareth Wilson, who is a Celestia leaseholder; Mark Thomas, also at Celestia and a member of Welsh Cladiators; Robert Nicholls, from Altamar Swansea and founder of Swansea Cladiators and a member of the Welsh Cladiators; and Geoff Spight, Altamar in Swansea also, and also a member of the Welsh Cladiators. Welcome to you all\u2014croeso. Let me begin with one or two initial questions before we move to other members of the committee. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Oh, yes, sorry, you are making a presentation initially, aren't you? I'm sorry. Who will present to us?\n\nMark Thomas: I will, Chair. And could I just confirm the timing, because I know you have a very busy agenda?\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: We have one hour in total for this evidence session, but a brief presentation to begin with is absolutely fine.\n\nMark Thomas: Sure, okay. So, first of all, diolch,&nbsp;thank you very much for your time. We realise you're very busy. We very much appreciate the opportunity of appearing before you. We would like to just make a quick presentation to give an overview of where we think we are now, because we remain deeply concerned about the slow progress that we're making in Wales on this crisis.However, in addition to thanking yourself, I'd also like to thank and make a public thanks to our colleagues in the Welsh fire and rescue services, because, in our view, they've been magnificent in supporting us over the last few years and, to some extent, as we'll come on to, they are also a victim of this crisis in terms of the pressure and workload that has been put on them, but we'd like to express our gratitude and thanks for their professionalism and support.The key thing I think that we want to emphasise today is the need for urgency with regard to this crisis. I think by now we'll know that on 14 June of this year it will be six years since the Grenfell tragedy. Six years is an awfully long time, and we remain deeply concerned about the slow rate of progress in Wales. And with that in mind, we recognise that none of us want to be here today. I'm supposed to be retired, Gareth has retired, and we have a lot of different victims caught up in this crisis. We're also clearly of the view that the crisis is not of our making, it's not of the making of the people that we propose to represent, and neither do we think it's the making of the Welsh Government. Developers and builders created this problem. But, at the same time, one of our concerns is that there seems to be a lack of understanding of the impact that this crisis is having on many hundreds of decent, ordinary people who did the right thing. They worked hard to prepare often for, like myself, a pension, to get on the housing ladder et cetera, et cetera, and they had surveys done, they bought what they thought were effective properties, and they've turned out to be disasters.And the range of victims, as you can see, is very, very high. We have pensioners whose pension plans&nbsp;are in turmoil, we have many young people. I know, in some blocks, people have had to move on, because they're trying to start a family; they need to move in order to change careers or jobs, and they're stuck. So, there are many different victims of this crisis. And I want to remind you here\u2014if I can just refer to this, because I can't see your screen; too far away\u2014that this was a letter sent from a leaseholder I know. He's in his mid to late 70s. He's a retired teacher who has done everything correct in his life, and he and his wife live just four minutes away from here, and this is a letter they wrote to Julie James back in December 2020 about the effect the crisis was having on their life. And personally, I know this gentleman; I'm not going to name him, because I don't want to embarrass him, but I have seen physically in his face and his mental condition the impact that the worry that this crisis has had. And just as that gentleman in 2020 urged Julie James to recognise that, we think that is being lost in this whole issue\u2014the human cost. And one of the fundamental problems that we think is at play here is that, as I'm sure many of you know, the corporate entity is a very tough animal. It only understands two things: it responds to the law of the land and profit erosion. And profit erosion is often competitor activity, customers moving away or Government regulation. And it's quite clear that developers have been incredibly profitable over the last decade or two in the United Kingdom, and there's a figure there\u2014they've made profits equalling \u00a331 billion in the last 10 years. So, these are people who can afford to repair our fire and build-defective homes. It's not a question of the Government needing to fund this; developers have the money to fund it.But the problem we have\u2014and we've lived this now, or I've lived this, almost seven days a week for the last four years\u2014is the corporate leadership of the companies involved. Their salaries are not based on responding to our needs. They only respond to the force of law, and I'd like to come back to that, because that's a key issue and concern we have about how we're currently approaching the problem in Wales, as opposed to the actions that are being taken in England. And just to illustrate that\u2014I won't go through every one of these\u2014it is concerning that, in recent times, the Minister, Julie James, has repeatedly thanked and commended developers for signing her pact and co-operating. And we get a lot of very positive words from developers, and you'll see down in the bottom right hand\u2014I think this comes, maybe, Gareth, from the pact or the pledge\u2014it talks about working in 'Good Faith', 'Work Constructively', 'No Liability', 'At Pace', 'Be Assured', 'As quickly as reasonably possible' and 'Within one month deliver a proposal'. And we have this very stark contrast between people using a lot of nice positive rhetoric and their feet moving in a different direction. So, at the same time that Richard Akers, the chairman of Redrow, is saying lots of positive things, I and my own development are in deep litigation with that company, which we don't want to be involved in. So, our whole approach is that, for years, developers have obfuscated and deflected responsibility for this crisis. The only thing that makes them move is legislation, and that's quite key. And I'd also\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Yes.\n\nGareth Wilson: If I could just make one comment while we've got this slide up, because it's a very interesting thing. But, in those quotes that Mark just ran through, which come from the pact and pledge, which are identical, essentially, the last one has an actual date or time in it: 'Within one month deliver a proposal', and that is the one thing that has not happened. The one concrete date that was in there simply has not happened. Sorry, Mark\u2014carry on.\n\nMark Thomas: Again, our concern is, at the moment, that in recent weeks, the Minister has been praising the likes of Taylor Wimpey and Bellway, but we know from on the ground that Taylor Wimpey are not engaging and communicating effectively with leaseholders in Victoria Wharf, Cardiff. And you will know that Victoria Wharf has had some three, thankfully, very minor fire incidents in the last six months or so. And we also know that if you go across the bay to Prospect Place, where Bellway are involved, they were apparently undertaking some remediation work, but their contractor has now gone bankrupt, or there's some other corporate crisis, and they've ceased working. So, again, we have this contrast between lofty rhetoric and the reality of what is actually happening on the ground. And there's a disconnect there that we think needs to be addressed.\n\n"}

This session today will provide us with an opportunity to hear about the chief nursing officer's priorities and nursing and midwifery professions in Wales, and to discuss challenges as well. Can I thank you both for being with us today and just ask you to introduce yourselves for the public record?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. My name is Sue Tranka, I am the Chief Nursing Officer for Wales, working at the Welsh Government. I'm also the nurse director for NHS Wales.\n\nGill Knight: Good morning, committee and Chair. My name is Gillian Knight. I'm a nursing officer working in the Welsh Government, working with the chief nursing officer.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482725\">FootnoteLink</a>\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Members will have various questions this morning, but if I can kick off with the first: is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good question, 'Is the nursing workforce in crisis?' I think you have to look across the globe to understand whether Wales's nursing workforce is in crisis. We are not unique within Wales. The World Health Organization has set out very clearly that the vacancies are over 50 per cent for the nursing and midwifery workforce across the globe, and that's of all the healthcare workers.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482718\">FootnoteLink</a> Within Wales, we have\u2014and you will have seen\u2014the RCN's report, 'Nursing in Numbers' from last year, and we are very grateful to the RCN for the work that they have done. But you will have seen a growing number of vacancies within the workforce.We have pieces of work that are ongoing to address the current vacancies. I think, if we are to continue along the path that the workforce is on, then we are certainly not going to be able to recoup what is becoming increasingly difficult challenges. I think there is a lot of work for us to do around the right recruitment, training the right numbers of staff, retaining the ones we have\u2014because we have incredible staff who are doing an exceptional job under very challenging, very difficult circumstances\u2014and then, we have to continue to attract the right people into the profession.\n\nRussell George AM: So, is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: I think it's really challenged. I think it's really very difficult currently. We have a growing number of vacancies, and I think there is work to be done. I'm not sure I would necessarily label it as 'crisis', but I think I would certainly say it is perhaps the most challenged position I have seen in my 31 years as a nurse.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you, Sue, for that. You've listed some of the challenges already, but in terms of setting the context for the rest of the session, perhaps just bullet-point what you think the challenges are, not just for the workforce within the community, but also in public health roles as well. So, what would you bullet-point are the specific challenges?\n\nSue Tranka: I don't think you can carve off challenges for community or challenges for public health nurses or challenges for the acute sector nurses. I think the entirety of the workforce is experiencing the same set of challenges, just in different levels of severity, I suspect. The challenges I think first and foremost are retention. I think we have a workforce who are making decisions about where else they would like to work, making decisions about the working conditions they are currently under, and making decisions to choose not to stay in nursing. So, retention is clearly one of the biggest issues we have within the nursing workforce.Second to that is that the Minister has invested a huge amount of money. I will ask Gill to confirm, but I think it's \u00a3260 million in 2023-24 in terms of training numbers and commissions and the training in education plan.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482719\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We have the highest number of nurses within Wales that we have had. Since 2016 I think it's 55 per cent that the commissions have grown. So, in terms of the recruitment of numbers, and the training numbers coming through, that's not necessarily the biggest problem, but you will be aware that we don't necessarily recruit to a 100 per cent of the training numbers we require and we need in Wales. So, I think recruitment in Wales is an issue. I think recruitment in Wales, in certain specialties as well, continues to be an issue.I think the health and well-being of our workforce is one that cannot be underestimated. Since the pandemic, since 2020, our workforce have been experiencing significant mental health, physical health and general health conditions. I think that is post-traumatic stress, moral injury and distress, and current circumstances will only lead you to have a look and see that nurses have made decisions about their own health in the workplace.&nbsp;So, I think, retention, recruitment, attraction are those big factors within the workforce. And working conditions cannot be underestimated. The working conditions have to be right to enable our workforce to stay, to have joy in their work, to want to continue to give of their very best in this very difficult landscape. So, I think those have to be considered as the top issues.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: A lot of what you've mentioned I think Members have got some specific questions on, so they'll pick those up later in the session. Are there any specific challenges in terms of the midwifery workforce that you would like to highlight?\n\nSue Tranka: I think I would start by saying that our midwifery workforce has grown by something like 97 per cent in the last five years, and that is really positive.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482720\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We continue to see our midwives stay with us, and we do retain our midwives. However, we have an emerging challenge in midwifery, which is not dissimilar to what we're seeing in nursing. I think what we are seeing in midwifery is a greater requirement on care. It's a greater demand on services. And I think that is reflected in whether our workforce continue to stay with us, if we can recruit the right numbers of midwives, and that we can care for those midwives in the services where they provide care, particularly over the community and acute sectors.I don't think the issues or the concerns that midwives experience are dissimilar to that which nurses experience. And I would go further to say that I don't think that these are unique to the nursing profession. I would say that healthcare workers across the sector, post-pandemic, in the last three years, have had the most challenged time that cannot be underestimated, from both a physical impact and mental health impact, and a general provision of services. I think it has been exceptional for them.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Yes, I quite understand. Thank you. Jack Sargeant.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, both; yes, it's still morning. The Minister is in negotiations at the moment with a number of trade unions, and I refer the Chair to my interest before as a trade union member. Can I ask what role you play as chief nursing officer in advising the Minister and the Welsh Government on nurses' pay in particular?\n\nSue Tranka: My role as an official does not extend into any pay negotiations; that is a matter for the Minister. The Minister is advised by the policy officials for workforce, the workforce director. My role is to offer any advice on any packages that are being put together, in order to understand, and, I suppose, assess, how that plays through to the nursing workforce. I think that is my entire role in terms of the professional advice that I would bring to the Minister. I do not engage in any of the further discussions on pay outside of the offer.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. I think that clears my question up very well.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Joyce, do you want to come in?\n\nJoyce Watson AM: I would ask if you have an opinion about the recent Welsh Government advice to health boards that lower risk patients could be discharged without a care package.\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you for that. I think, first, I'd like to clear up any misinterpretations of that letter. Contextually, it's really important to set out why that letter was sent. Currently, in our healthcare provision across Wales, we have anything between 1,700 to 2,000 patients who should not be in our acute beds because they do not require emergency, urgent or acute care. I think having patients in acute beds is fundamentally wrong for those patients\u2014they become more unwell, they tend to deteriorate, they decondition significantly and then we go into a cycle of requiring further care. So, these patients should certainly not be there.The letter that we sent out during a very difficult period was not that patients should go home without a package of care\u2014that would be irresponsible, and that goes against my professional values and that of the Welsh Government. What we have asked is that those who do not have a perfect package of care\u2014. And let me give you an example of what that means: a patient waiting to go home for support in the home for something like a two or three-times-a-day package of care. Whilst waiting for that full package to be put in place, the request was whether a conversation could be had with the patient, family members, loved ones, if somebody could support that patient with that extra requirement in the day until that full package could come into effect.I think that is a fair request, at a time when the harm in the community is so high, when patients can\u2019t be seen, when they cannot be conveyed to hospital, when they are having really severe and significant conditions awaiting care\u2014that we ask a question of that nature. And I think that was the responsible thing to do. I think the key here is that we wanted it to be a safe discharge and that is really an important thing to understand. There is a set of assessments and procedures that take place at a health board level prior to a patient being discharged. By no means does a letter leave the Welsh Government and a health board chooses to discharge a patient simply without applying any type of professional judgment.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: How would we monitor? Is there a capacity in place to monitor? Whilst it might be safe medically, there's the social aspect to that and the pressures on the wider workforce that you previously mentioned in trying to deliver that. How do we monitor the need for care, which might not be medical, but nonetheless is there, and the pressure that that might then in turn put on those delivering it without that full care package and ensuring their well-being?\n\nSue Tranka: There is a mechanism currently by which we review that. For example, where community nurses need to step into that space temporarily to support a package of care that is not a full package of care currently, we will record that through what we have in the community system currently, which is a digital system that monitors demand and capacity and scheduling. So, we would look at what is the additional demand that is coming into the community, how they\u2019ve managed to reschedule and move their work around to manage within the community provision, and then understand that gap and then do some work to understand what needs to be done to close that gap. It is quite a new system. It\u2019s been in place only a couple of months. We are waiting for a full read-out of that data, which will probably be in the next six months or so, where we can understand it. Currently, it is there, it is being assessed on a daily basis by those who are using it, but the Welsh Government hasn\u2019t had a full report yet and we won\u2019t have one for a few months yet.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: Thank you.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Just to follow up on Jack Sargeant's question, I suppose, and to understand more about your role\u2014. I ask the question in the context of the current negotiations and views in terms of nurses' pay and conditions. I'm just trying to understand how you balance perhaps potentially two different elements of your role. One is providing recommendations and guidance to the Welsh Government, as you've set out to Jack, and the other is being the voice of the nursing profession and standing up for the nursing profession, who clearly have a different view at the moment in terms of pay and conditions to the Government. So, how do you balance those two positions?\n\n"}

It increased by 30%."], "answer": "D", "content": "John Griffiths AM: Then we will move on to item 2, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our third evidence session, with the Minister for Climate Change, Julie James. Welcome, Minister, and welcome to your officials, Emma Williams, the director for housing and regeneration, and Dean Medcraft, director of finance and operations. Okay, Minister, we'd better move swiftly on. Let me begin, then, with a general question: to what extent has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 shaped the budget allocations within the climate change portfolio, and how has the Government's commitment to that Act been balanced with the need to address present-day cost-of-living and other pressures?\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Chair. There's no doubt at all that we're facing one of the most difficult and challenging budget settlements in Wales that we've ever faced as a result of choices made elsewhere. Inflation has also eroded our budget to worryingly low levels, and local authorities and NHS organisations are reporting significant shortfalls in funding as a result of the inflationary increases, the pay pressures, and, of course, the rising energy costs. So, there's no getting away from the fact that this has required us to make really, really difficult choices, and the UK Government has just failed to address the significant funding gap that should have uplifted our budgets in line with inflation in order to maintain the vital public services that we all rely on. So, the reality is that we could not meet all the pressures identified to support cost-of-living interventions within the funding available.But, despite that, we always maintain our approach rooted in the well-being of future generations Act, so we've undertaken to maximise the impact of the available resources that we do have, balancing our short-term needs with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and trying to make the longer term change and delivery that we want for our programme for government ambitions, including tackling poverty. This has resulted in the Government, across the Government, undertaking an exercise to review all of our budgets and prioritise our support where it was needed most, building on the actions that we already outlined as part of the spending review last year. I'm sure that the Chair is aware that the budget round this year has been supported by the work of the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee, which I'm a core member of.The result of that was that we put additional allocations into the discretionary assistance fund, homelessness services and the pupil development grant\u2014[<em>Interruption.</em>] Excuse me, Chair. The cost-of-living crisis and its impact on household budgets means that many people have been unable to pay their rent or other household bills, and, for my portfolio, the risk of them falling into rent arrears and subsequently facing eviction is a real, real concern. We do not want to push individuals towards seeking homelessness support from the local authority; we want them to go into homelessness prevention support, and we want to try to keep people in their homes where at all possible. I'm sure, Chair, that you'll remember from previous sessions with me, and I'm sure you've had evidence from elsewhere, that we continue to have very high levels of presentations for homelessness services right across Wales. So, I'm pleased to say that we have managed to find an additional allocation of \u00a310 million to put into the homelessness budget and to maintain our 'no-one left out' approach to be sure that no-one is forced to sleep rough. The additional funding is going to go into homelessness prevention measures, including where it cannot be prevented to meet the costs of temporary accommodation.I'm sure that the committee is also aware that we've had absolutely no funding commitment from the UK Government for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We funded our supersponsor scheme, including accommodation and wraparound support using funding from Welsh Government reserves, and we continue to support people arriving from Ukraine. We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales. We've committed \u00a320 million to supporting our Ukrainian humanitarian response as well, and that's to ensure that our really hard-pressed local authorities are able to continue offering the services that we've put in place.And then, Chair, I think what I really want the committee to understand is that, obviously, the part that you're looking at from my budget is part of a much bigger MEG, as we call it\u2014the main expenditure group. And so, we've had to look across right across the MEG to balance out how to get through the pain of this budget, and that's the word that has to be used. It's been a really, really, really difficult thing to do, and we've had to look at an enormous number of things that are essential to be able to push our progressive plans forward.So, we continue to outline a vision and our short and medium-term plans, including preventative plans, to push forward the reform. So, we continue, for example, to resource putting our homelessness legislation onto the statute book; we continue to look at embedding the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ways of working across the piece, including transparency and impact reform; we also continue to try to maintain the longer term strategies that we have for things like decarbonisation, for retrofit, and so on, balanced with the real sharp-point crisis that we've been facing and trying to move the money around, so that we're both helping people in the here and now, but also not making it worse for people later on because we've moved that money around. There's no getting away from the fact that it's been a real, real challenge to do so, and, as I say, we've had to look right across the whole expenditure group to do that, and the money has been moved accordingly in an attempt to do that. I'll leave it there. I'm sure that you'll get into some of the specifics, but I want the committee to fully understand the sheer scale of the budget process that we've been going through in order to try and squeeze some of this cost-of-living money out of the budget.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Okay, Minister. Thank you very much for that overview and, as you say, we'll be coming on to many of those matters with subsequent questions. Firstly, Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister and members of your office. May I apologise that I can't be there in person? I have personal reasons that mean that I am stuck here in north Wales at the moment. Minister, you mentioned in your opening statement about homelessness. Just in general on that point, do you feel that homelessness services and support services for homelessness are being prioritised in this budget?\n\nJulie James AM: Diolch, Mabon. Yes, absolutely. So, the data shows clearly that demand is increasing. I've just said in my opening remarks that we know that the pressure on homelessness services across Wales hasn't abated and, in some places, has actually increased. We also know that the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing are adding to the drivers that drive people into home loss. We also know that prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address homelessness. So, we're not going to row back on our 'no-one left out' policy, despite the real serious pressures that we've facing. So, recognising those pressures, the prevention budget will increase by \u00a350 million in 2023-24, an additional \u00a310 million more than previously planned, and that takes our investment in homelessness and housing support to over \u00a3207 million next year.&nbsp;In recognition of the support services required to keep people in their homes as well, we increased the housing support grant budget by \u00a340 million in 2021-22 to \u00a3166.763 million, which is a 30 per cent rise. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the incredibly difficult budget pressure that we've had this year\u2014and it has been incredibly difficult\u2014we have managed to maintain that substantial increase in this year's budget, and then going forward into the 2023-24 budget. So, the answer, I suppose, in a nutshell is that there is obviously more that we could do; there's always going to be more we can do in the face of the current cost-of-living pressure. But, I'm very pleased that we've managed to maintain services at the increased level that we were able to put them in, and we've just managed to get another \u00a310 million into homelessness services themselves. We continue to scrutinise the budget every day, I assure you, looking for extra ways to increase money into this essential service.&nbsp;\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Minister, for that response. If I may go to the narrative of the draft budget as I read it and as we saw it back in December, in that narrative, it mentions the effect of low pay and cost of living on the front-line staff of homelessness services. There was an example that 44 per cent of the workforce were unable to pay bills, that 11 per cent of them were unable to pay rent, et cetera. But, this, again, this year, is a flat settlement, compared to\u2014. I accept that you say that you've increased it in previous years, but in the last year, we've seen huge inflation, so this settlement, which is flat, is a real-terms cut in the settlement, which means that we will then see more of the front-line workforce leaving their jobs, and then more pressure on services. So, in considering the targets that we have\u2014you've mentioned some of them\u2014and the fact that we're likely to see more of that workforce leave and unable to do their work, and additional pressure, do you feel that this settlement is fair for that sector in particular?&nbsp;And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you\u2019re putting towards these services that are provided is enough? [Translation should read: And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you're providing is able to go towards these services that are provided by front-line staff?]&nbsp;\n\n"}

Welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Finance and Local Government. The first question today is from Hefin David.\n\nHefin David AM: 1. What assessment has the Welsh Government made of the potential impact of increasing the basic rate of income tax in Wales? OQ59146\n\nRebecca Evans AM: Raising the basic rate would add additional costs on those less able to afford it at a time when the UK Government has frozen income tax thresholds, dragging lower earners into the income tax system.\n\nHefin David AM: I think the key point made by the Minister there is that, at the time, I think income tax is something that should be revisited in the future, but she's absolutely right to say that this is not the time for it. Last week, we saw an amendment to the Welsh Government's budget by Plaid Cymru that would have cost people on the basic rate \u00a32.47 a week extra, during a cost-of-living crisis. Personally, my view is that the co-operation agreement should not have allowed that amendment to be put, given that it covers the budget, and it was disappointing to see that that happened outside the co-operation agreement. We should see Plaid Cymru taking responsibility for the power they have in the Senedd Chamber. Would the Minister be willing, though, to review this position in the future, should economic circumstances allow at some point?\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I'm very grateful to Hefin David for the question, and for raising Welsh rates of income tax this afternoon. And I completely agree with his assessment that it is not the right time, in a cost-of-living crisis, to be asking those who are on the absolute lowest incomes, and indeed those who have been drawn into the income tax system for the very first time, to be paying more. And I think it's well established that, to raise any serious amount of money in order to boost the resources that we have, we would be required to raise the basic rate of income tax. I do think that it has to be done in a considered and strategic way. That said, every single year, we do assess our options, in terms of how we use the Welsh rates of income tax, and we would expect to look afresh again at this issue next year, both in terms of people's overall tax burden and contribution, depending on where things are with the UK Government, and, of course, the wider economic situation that people find themselves in. But, absolutely, it's something that we consider afresh for every budget.\n\nTom Giffard MS: As we heard from Hefin David there, one of the perils of increasing income tax at a time of financial trouble is the fact that it would be something built on the back of working people across Wales. And it's quite apt, I think, on the day that Nicola Sturgeon resigned as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland, to remember exactly where Plaid Cymru got this idea from, because they devolve a lot of their thinking out to a party from another part of the United Kingdom\u2014the SNP. Because, in Scotland, they're proposing to add 1p onto the higher and top rates of tax, alongside reducing the top rate threshold, from \u00a3150,000 to just over \u00a3125,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that that will spark an exodus of high earners across the border. Scottish business leaders have branded it a disadvantage for Scotland and made clear that it would make competing with the UK for talent much harder. On top of those increases, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has not ruled out a 10 per cent hike in council taxes there. In a survey, half of all Scots wanted the current system of council tax to end. Another survey showed that one in five Scottish households are currently living in serious financial difficulty, equivalent to 1.2 million people; in the UK overall, it's 17 per cent. That's Plaid's vision for Wales, Minister, and it's a vision that's built on the back of taxing working people. Do you agree with me that that's a totally wrong priority, at the wrong time, from a party that is increasingly out of touch with the people of Wales?\n\nRebecca Evans AM: Well, I would gently remind the Member that, under the UK Conservative Government, the tax burden on people in Wales, and across the UK, is now at a 70-year high as a result of the decisions that that Government has made. But I do think that Scottish rates of income tax are very much a matter for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament, but that doesn't mean that we can't learn from their experiences, which is why we're very interested in the work that HMRC is progressing in terms of developing a longitudinal data set. Now, that hopefully will allow us to have some more detailed analysis of the behavioural impacts of tax changes, including migration responses, and my officials are in frequent contact with HMRC to better understand the possibilities that that work might release.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: 2. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Climate Change and the Minister for Social Justice regarding Welsh Government support to ease the financial pressures on scheduled bus services? OQ59129\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I regularly engage with my Cabinet colleagues on funding issues. In this financial year, we have made available over \u00a3110 million of funding to protect and grow bus services right across Wales. The bus emergency scheme has also been extended into the next financial year.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's undoubtedly the case, Minister, that cross-Government working, finding the money to put in place the emergency bus support and also extending it now for the next few months has been critical to ensuring the survival of the bus industry in Wales, including independent operators, small family operators and so on that run their businesses. But we know the pressures that your budget is under, but we also do know that this is genuinely a climate justice issue, and it's also a social justice issue, as we keep being told, quite rightly. And we can repeat this endlessly until it gets into people's minds that 80 per cent of those people who use buses have no other alternative. So, can I simply urge\u2014this is not asking for magic money\u2014but can I genuinely urge her, in her discussions with the Minister for Climate Change, and the Minister for Social Justice and Cabinet colleagues, to do all she possibly can to try and find that way that we can keep these bus services going in all our communities\u2014rural and urban Wales. It's vital, going forward, particularly after the announcement yesterday about turning a corner a different way to deal with shifting people to more sustainable travel.&nbsp;\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I'm grateful for the question and completely agree with the points that are made about bus services being a critical part of our approach to delivering social justice here in Wales, and, of course, an important part of our environmental aspirations as well. I think that our support for the bus industry through the pandemic and now at the other side of the pandemic has been absolutely crucial in terms of maintaining the services that we do have in Wales. But it was a bus emergency scheme, and I think that this level of subsidy is just not sustainable in the long term, which is really why we are looking at reviewing the bus services support grant, to move the industry away from that kind of reliance on the emergency funding to something that is much more stable in the future. And colleagues will be aware of our ambitious plans, in terms of the bus Bill that we aim to bring forward, to bring more control back to local authorities in terms of the services that are provided. So, I think that, really, is the longer term answer, but, in the meantime, our support is really important for the industry.&nbsp;\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: Minister, I have raised on a number of occasions the plight of residents across my region who have suffered as the result of cuts to scheduled bus services.&nbsp;The most recent issue brought to my attention is a proposal by First Cymru to cut services to Resolven in my region.&nbsp;Many people in Resolven, particularly the elderly, are dependent upon the X7 service, as their nearest post office or bank is over seven miles away. Any reduction in service will have a bad impact on a community like Resolven.&nbsp;I have also been contacted by Neath Port Talbot Council, who are concerned that the Welsh Government\u2019s decision to axe bus emergency scheme 3 funding is leading to the acceleration in cuts to these bus services. If BES3 funding goes, companies operating services within Port Talbot and Neath will deregister most routes within the county borough. Minister, will you reconsider the decision to end BES3 funding and look at other ways to support a struggling bus industry that is so vital to many of our constituents?\n\n"}

We're undertaking Stage 2 proceedings today for the Agriculture (Wales) Bill. We have the Minister with us today, Lesley Griffiths, and her officials. Would you like to just introduce your officials for the record?\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly. Thank you, Chair. So, over on my left, I have Emma Davies, who is the agricultural Bill manager and Dorian Brunt, who is the senior lawyer for the rural affairs team. And on my right, Hannah Fernandez, head of policy instructions for the Bill, and Mark Alexander, deputy director for land management reform.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you for that, Minister, and welcome to you all.So, the marshalled list of amendments is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled, marshalled into the order that has been agreed by the committee on 16 February. The groupings list shows how amendments have been grouped in order to facilitate the debates today, and the order in which the amendments are called and moved for a vote is dictated by the marshalled list.&nbsp;So, I want to\u2014. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair, I will move the amendments in the name of the Minister, and for expediency, I will assume that the Minister wants to move all of the amendments that have been tabled in her name at the appropriate time, in accordance with the marshalled list. Minister, if you don't&nbsp;want me to do that, then please indicate at the relevant point in the proceedings.So, in line with our usual practice, we've got legal advisers to the committee who are present today and that means that we can suspend proceedings should Members wish to take advantage of that at any time\u2014that legal advice. And in addition, Minister, you can also receive advice, of course, from your officials, hopefully by passing a note, of if you wish to do so, we can suspend proceedings as well, should you need us to do that.\n\nDarren Millar AM: So, we'll start with group 1 of the 16 groups that we have to discuss today: the sustainable land management objectives and the first group of amendments that we're going to be discussing. The lead amendment in this group is amendment 57. I therefore call on Luke Fletcher to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group. I call on Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd, and I move the amendments. And right off the bat, I'd just like to thank the clerks and legal team for their patience with myself as a new Member in going through this process.I'll speak to amendments 57, 1A, 3 and 4. On amendment 57, this amendment seeks to include a requirement relating to protecting food security in SLM objectives. Food security is a critical issue. It directly impacts the health and well-being of people, the environment and economy. Wales has a high level of poverty and food insecurity, particularly among low-income households, which can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Sustainable land management can help to address this issue by promoting the production of nutritious, affordable and locally grown food.&nbsp;Although clause 1 within the Bill includes the production of food as part of the first SLM objective, what we are seeking to do is to provide a clear target for meeting this objective, which must be around ensuring the food security of citizens and access to food to promote good health and well-being.On amendment 1A, which is an amendment, actually, to amendment 1, we're seeking to change 'farmer' to 'active farmer' to ensure that we are clear as to who receives support.On amendment 3, economic resilience is just as important to Welsh farmers as environmental resilience because it is essential for their long-term sustainability and ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions. By investing in both economic and environmental resilience, farmers can build a sustainable and profitable farming operation that can withstand the challenges of the future.And finally, Chair, on amendment 4,&nbsp;'The fifth objective is to seek to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities, recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and agricultural production to the rural economy, and in doing so\u2014'(a) to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and'(b) to contribute to achieving the well-being goals in section 4 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.'\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Luke. I call on Sam Kurtz.\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd like to echo Luke Fletcher's thanks and praise to the legal team and the clerking team for their hand-holding through this process. I am most grateful for that. Speaking to amendment 1, it has been tabled in order to remove any ambiguity in relation to the sustainable land management objective 4. By precisely linking the fourth objective to the role of the farmer, we seek to recognise their integral role in supporting and delivering the objectives of the sustainable land management objective 4. This sits in line with recommendation 10 of the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee report into the Agriculture (Wales) Bill, which seeks to provide explicit policy intent for the support of strong and vibrant rural communities, as was sought by key industry stakeholders.&nbsp;Touching on amendment 1A, I would like to welcome this from Luke Fletcher, and therefore will be supporting it. In relation to amendment 43, the inclusion of the phrase 'landscape' has been made in order to remove any ambiguity about the land we seek to conserve, enhance and promote, as outlined within the fourth objective of this legislation, making it more explicit than 'countryside' alone\u2014indeed, looking at every form of land, be that mountains, uplands, moorlands, seascapes, semi-urban areas, et cetera. So, through recognising this, we also seek to acknowledge that each category possesses its own unique, distinctive character and, with that, separate necessities that require tailored support and assistance.Speaking to amendment 2, the use of the phrase 'existing' has been chosen to, once again, remove any ambiguity as to what farmers should be seeking to promote\u2014in this instance, public access within land designated for agricultural purposes. I'm sure that the Minister will be familiar with the reservations that some have made with regard to public access, especially should that be land that is home to farm animals. What this amendment seeks to do is secure existing public access and provide landowners with a key objective through which they can seek to enhance existing access. By permitting this, we can seek to alleviate significant barriers to increasing the public's connection with and understanding of the natural environment.&nbsp;Speaking to amendment 3, this has been tabled to strengthen the fourth objective in order to recognise the significance of rural economic viability through the means of protecting farm businesses. By protecting, enhancing and promoting the countryside and landscape, cultural resources and public access, we encompass the wider role of the rural economy, sustaining its viability. This amendment seeks to formally recognise that arrangement and enshrine it on the statute book, in line with the aspiration set out within recommendation 10 of the committee report.&nbsp;And finally, Chair, amendment 4 has been tabled with the purpose of introducing a fifth sustainable land management objective, one that seeks to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities through recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and the practice of agricultural production to the rural economy. Land management decisions to achieve the biodiversity, climate and sustainable food objectives cannot be divorced from the economic and social needs or influences that farming families and food supply chain businesses experience. Therefore, we are highly unlikely to achieve our aims at the scale and pace required unless we protect and enhance the economic viability of families and communities delivering the outcomes within the sustainable land management objectives. Thank you, Chair.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. Are there any other members of the committee who wish to speak? If there aren't, then I call on the Minister.&nbsp;\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd just like to begin by thanking Members for their remarks, for their amendments to the Bill and for this opportunity to set out the Government's position regarding them all. I just want to assure Members that both I and my officials have really considered the amendments in detail. Obviously, I'll respond to each amendment in turn and then also introduce amendment 29, which is tabled in my name.Amendment 57: the first amendment in this group alters the first objective so that contributing to the sustainable production of food and other goods is'to protect or improve the food security of citizens and access to food that promotes good health and wellbeing.\u2019Welsh agriculture has a key role to play as the producer of high-quality food, helping to feed our nation and other nations. Food security and access to food that promotes good health and well-being is, however, much, much wider than that, relating to supply-chain considerations, wages, transport, the availability of shops, benefits, healthcare, housing, et cetera. And of course, most of these lie outside the scope of this agricultural Bill, which is why this amendment cannot be accepted.Amendment 1 and amendment 1A, which is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective: the purpose of amendment 1 and amendment 1A appears to seek to limit the fourth SLM objective to farmers, or active farmers only. The concepts of 'farmer' or 'active farmer' do not appear in the Bill, and none of the SLM objectives refer to these terms. So, it's not the policy intention to limit the fourth SLM objective in this way. Introducing this concept now could have unknown consequences for other parts of the Bill. So, for example, a reference in one place of the Bill to a 'farmer' or an 'active farmer' may imply that other parts of the Bill do not apply to the farmer or active farmer. And this is a possible consequence that I'm sure all Members would wish to avoid.&nbsp;Amendment 43: this is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective to refer specifically to landscapes in the countryside, and I don't think this amendment is necessary, as non-urban landscapes are considered to be captured within the term 'countryside', which is already referenced in the fourth objective.&nbsp;Amendment 2 to the fourth SLM objective would limit scope of public access under that provision to what is existing only. Public access is not static, it changes through the actions of farmers and landowners, and others updating access rights. So, restricting action to existing public access is therefore contrary to the policy intention to promote public access to the countryside and our cultural resources.&nbsp;Amendment 3: as I've just mentioned, none of the SLM objectives refer to farmer or any other beneficiary or actor. So, it's therefore not appropriate to include a reference to protecting their economic viability.Amendment 4: this amendment introduces a new SLM objective that is not required. Having resilient agriculture businesses that contribute to our thriving rural communities and help sustain current and future generations of farmers is important. And the intention of this amendment appears to seek to ensure that the Government, potentially, underwrites rural livelihoods, which is outside of the scope of the Bill, and not appropriate. It would also exclude non-rural communities, where agriculture and ancillary activities may take place. And the proposed Government amendment 29 recognises the importance of agricultural businesses in the communities in which they operate.Amendment 29, I'm very pleased to bring this forward, it is the result of productive discussions with Plaid Cymru, as part of the co-operation agreement. The amendment makes provision about factors relevant to determining whether food and other goods are produced in a sustainable manner for the purposes of the first SLM objective. The amendment is intended to highlight the link between the production of food and other goods in a sustainable way, and the resilience of agricultural businesses within the communities in which they operate. Resilient agricultural businesses are vitally important to Wales, contributing to our thriving rural communities, and sustaining Welsh agricultural land for our future generations. Businesses that are resilient and adaptive are more likely to thrive and survive shocks to the sector, such as those we've seen caused by pandemics, conflicts, supply chain issues and climate change. So, I therefore ask that Members agree my amendment 29, and do not agree amendments 57 and 1A in the name of Luke Fletcher, and amendments 1, 43, 2, 3 and 4 in the name of Sam Kurtz. Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Minister. I call on Luke Fletcher to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd. It's naturally disappointing that the Government won't be supporting our amendments. On amendment 57, I think it's important to note that, with the other sustainable land management objectives having much more of an environmental and social focus, it is vital that the sustainable land management objective has clarity around the food production and food security goals. Chair, I propose that we move to a vote.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. So, the question is that amendment 57 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] There is an objection, so we'll proceed to a vote. Those in favour, please raise your hands. And those against. So, I can see that there's a tied vote, so I use my casting vote in the negative, that is, against the amendment, in accordance with Standing Order 6.20(ii). Therefore, amendment 57 is not agreed.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Luke Fletcher, before we dispose of amendment 1, we need to dispose of the amendment to that amendment, which has been tabled in your name\u2014amendment 1A. Do you move that amendment?\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: I move.\n\n"}

Are all Members content? Thank you. Well, I note I believe that all Members are content. The clerk, therefore, will now change the settings from public to private, and we will then continue with the meeting.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Bore da. Croeso. Good morning and welcome back to the Public Accounts and Public Administration Committee, meeting this morning remotely. I welcome our guests who'll be giving evidence to committee. I'd be grateful if you could state your names and roles for the record, perhaps starting with Mr Prentice.\n\nPhil Prentice: Hello. My name's Phil Prentice, I'm the chief officer of Scotland's Towns Partnership and the national programme director for Scotland's Improvement Districts.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you very much. And, Mr Roe.\n\nRichard Roe: Good morning, everyone. My name's Richard Roe, I am the corporate director for place at Trafford Council.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you very much indeed. Actually, you're not very far from where I'm sitting at the moment, ironically, albeit across that incredible border.As you'd expect, we have a number of questions, and I would ask both Members and witnesses to be as succinct as possible so that we can cover as wide a range of issues as possible generated by this topic. I will start with the questions to the witnesses. I'll start by asking you to what extent you believe that local authorities in your own jurisdictions are able to effectively create local coalitions of change and bring together all the key players to help regenerate and improve towns. I don't know which of you would like to go first.\n\nPhil Prentice: I'm happy to go first, Mark. I think it's a mixed picture across the country. Some local authorities are very good at this, others less so. So, there genuinely isn't consistency across the piece. But, I would say that, where we see success, it's where local government works very positively with its community and business partnerships and there's trust and an understanding of roles and remits. No one sector is going to be able to fix this problem on its own, and I think there has to be a growing recognition that we do need much more collaboration, but it is a mixed picture.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Would Richard Roe like to comment?\n\nRichard Roe: Yes. I agree with Phil. I think I would say it's a mixed picture. But, if it's going to work, if you're going to successfully regenerate town centres, then it needs the local authority to lead. We are the key player in that role, but the local authority can't do it on its own. So, you do need a coalition with business, with community, with other public sector partners. That's certainly our experience. I think the private sector wants the local authority to step into that space, they want the local authority to take the lead, they want the local authority to create the right environment for investment, and then they will follow. I think the community is the same. I think that has to be the approach. I think, as Phil said, the appetite in different local authorities may not be there.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In the evidence we've received thus far, we've seen local authorities taking the leadership in some towns, but we've also seen town councils, for example, different tiers of local government, taking the lead in other areas, which goes back to the words you referred to in terms of working together and collaboration and partnership. To what extent, from your experience, have you seen local authorities having the right skills with their lead partners in terms of leadership, resources, buy-in and capacity to regenerate towns in the areas where you're working?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll go first, if you don't mind. Again, it's a similar picture. I think local authorities have suffered disproportionately in terms of development departments\u2014economic, housing\u2014through the period of austerity over the last 12 to 15 years. Usually, it's these functions that will have been depleted. That said, I think there's an opportunity here for a regional approach, whereby a lot of those skill sets could be shared across a number of local authorities. In Scotland, we've got a unitary system of 32. We don't have to have specialists in 32 local authorities on housing or finance or net zero; you could actually be doing that at a regional level and driving efficiency. So, we're seeing much more of that through the city and regional growth deals and the regional economic partnerships, particularly in the south of Scotland where we've got a new enterprise agency. They've taken a much more clearly defined role in leading on town-centre regeneration and working more closely with the local authority. So, they're actually bringing the capacity into local government for that period of time, and additional resources, skills and so on. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about structure, so long as the activity is being delivered. But we are facing difficult times around resourcing, so I think there must be more collaboration and a regional approach taken.\n\nRichard Roe: I think there is, undoubtedly, a capacity challenge and a financial challenge, but some of this comes down to prioritisation and the extent to which the authority puts town-centre regeneration as being a priority, and therefore puts resources behind that. I do think there's an opportunity for collaboration. Certainly, within greater Manchester, we do that across the 10 districts and with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, on the basis that that gives us collectively more scope, more buying power. I think there is also scope if you're going to do it with a public, private or community sector partnership, to bring in some of those resources from outside. It doesn't mean the authority has to do everything itself; you can tap into and bring in private sector resources to add in, and that's certainly something that we try and do and push as much as we can.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Have you witnessed or seen any pushback from, say, senior people who don't want to share power in practice, and want to be in charge and carry on in the old way? How's that being managed to get them on board?\n\nRichard Roe: I think there's always some pushback. There are always little power bases. I think the starting point is to get the shared vision. So, certainly, our approach in our town centre\u2014so, in Altrincham and now in Stretford\u2014has been working to get a shared vision, shared ambition, and once you've got that, you've got something you can align behind and that becomes the priority. But that's the starting point.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In terms of the planning system, again, to what extent in your experience do you believe this has been flexible enough to support businesses and partners to respond quickly to problems when they arise, and, if it hasn't, what should be done to improve this? Of course, I'm aware\u2014as obviously, clearly you are\u2014the planning systems in Scotland, Wales and England are not completely aligned, but nonetheless similar issues apply.\n\nPhil Prentice: Again, I'll pitch in from Scotland. We have just published 'National Planning Framework 4', so the new national plan framework has just been approved by the Scottish Parliament. That was actually quite timely because we'd already begun to understand the ongoing trends around it, the decline in retail, and how citizen behaviour had changed, and the urgency around climate. So, a lot of the new policies point towards that. We also have a town-centre policy now called 'A New Future for Scotland's Town Centres', and things that will actually reduce our carbon footprint, that will put more energy back into our town centres, particularly by repopulating and driving residential solutions. So, the planning system, I think, that we have is fit for purpose, and certainly over the last few months, some of the early tests around out-of-town sprawl development have actually been called in by the Scottish Government, and the applications have been refused.So, I think it's important that the Welsh Government gets its story straight, and that there is an alignment within the Welsh Government to make sure there's a consistent approach, because at the end of the day, the planning framework should really encourage the right sort of investment, and we should only be funding the right sort of investment. So, if you get your story straight to begin with, most of the jigsaw pieces will then ultimately fall into place. And all commercial investors want to see is consistency and longevity. They want to know that this is the way it's going to be long term, and the money will then follow up after that. So, I think we have actually got a pretty decent planning system. Obviously, the proof will be in the pudding and the delivery over the next few years, but at least the policy is very solid.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Mr Roe.&nbsp;\n\nRichard Roe: I think I'm probably slightly less optimistic than Phil on this. I think there are some challenges in the planning system. I think it can be slow to get policy changes made. Actually, in our full council last night, we adopted a new planning policy, the civic quarter area action plan, just outside one of our town centres, but it's taken us four years to get that adopted, to go through the system that we have to go through. And we've ended up\u2014. We're adopting it in a very different place from when we started. So, I do think there are some challenges in getting policy and being able to move policy quickly enough to respond to a changing economic environment.&nbsp;I think permitted development rights and the conversion of office to residential gives us some challenges as well, in terms of our ability to manage how that transition&nbsp;from commercial to residential is led, not that we're against bringing more residential into the town centre. That's something that we want to do, but we also want to manage how it works from the commercial basis. You're always recognising in the planning system that you're potentially trying to balance out people with very different interests, and that is always one part of the challenge.Having said that, I think that, used properly, there are some advantages and some strengths in the planning system when you look at individual applications. We have got a neighbourhood business plan in Altrincham, which was worked on and led by the local community, owned by the local community, and they're still very involved with the design panel in looking at development within Altrincham town centre. So, used properly, it can be of benefit, but there are some structural challenges, I think.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: And what, in your view, needs to change to address those?\n\nRichard Roe: I think that some of it is a national-level policy change. The nature of planning is that it takes a long time to do. Within greater Manchester, we're working on a regional strategy now, 'Places for Everyone', across nine of the 10 districts. We've been working on that for seven years now, to get that through. That's a long time to get your baseline planning policy in place. These things are complex, they're large, they're difficult, but there's got to be a way for us to get policy decisions made slightly quicker. Because Phil's right\u2014what the private sector and what the community wants is certainty and understanding. And actually, when you're going through the system, creating planning policy, you're putting uncertainty into the system, and always with the danger that there's a change in national policy, which actually then means that the baseline that you should be working against starts to change.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Again, based upon your experiences, what needs to happen to get other public sector partners, for example health trusts, boards, universities, or otherwise, to work with councils to deliver regeneration in towns?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll pitch in. I think, in Scotland, we've taken a very different approach. We haven't looked at it solely through the prism of town centres\u2014we've looked at it through the prism of place. And through that, we developed a place principle, which was co-signed by local government and the Scottish Government and a number of our key agencies\u2014the likes of enterprise agencies, transport, VisitScotland and the third sector. And the rationale behind that was really that place is the responsibility of all actors, and, ultimately, all actors will have a distinct role to play in actually making the place better, making it work better for citizens, ultimately. And that does involve transportation, it involves health, it involves housing, it involves the environment. But I think that having that discussion at the place-based partnership gives us a much better opportunity to create a holistic vision, and to look at how resources are aligned in the longer term. It even considers disinvestments\u2014an honest discussion about what has to go and what's not affordable any more. So, I think, taking a place-based approach has broadened out the discussion, and no longer is town-centre regeneration seen to be solely the remit of local authorities\u2014it's actually seen to be everybody's responsibility. The principle was launched in 2018, so it's still taking time to embed, but most place partnerships now do involve constituent elements of local authorities\u2014usually being the main driver\u2014but other key community planning partners, particularly health, heritage and economy. And that approach genuinely has widened out and improved the approach to places, which, ultimately, has affected a lot of town centres positively. Because, a wee bit like Wales, Scotland is very much a nation of towns, with the exception of a couple of cities. So, it's where the bulk of our population and businesses reside, and we're need to actually grasp that nettle and just work collegiately to make it better.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. And Richard Roe.\n\n"}

For the social partnership council to function in a manner that is to be expected, that is, one that shows impartiality and fairness in proceedings, I believe that an independent chair is necessary.

For these reasons, my amendments in this group would also reduce the number of times that the SPC&nbsp;meets, guarantee that the SPC&nbsp;can continue to meet if the chair is not present, and ensure that any expenses claimed as part of participation in the council are reasonable. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of these meetings, amendment 43 will ensure that all meetings will be properly prepared for the meeting by having copies of the agenda for a meeting of the SPC to be published electronically at least 14 days before that meeting, or, if the meeting is convened at a shorter notice, then as soon as is reasonably practicable.

It feels entirely appropriate that this important council is chaired by somebody with the stature and seniority as that of the First Minister. So, I don't support this amendment. Diolch yn fawr iawn.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: I'd now like to call on the Member in charge to speak to amendment 1, and any other of the amendments in front of us on this subject.&nbsp;\n\nHannah Blythyn AM: Thank you, Chair. I'll speak to the Government's amendment 1 first. This amendment responds to the committee's Stage 1 recommendation No. 4, which proposed that a duty be placed on Welsh Ministers to consult with social partnership council members before making revisions to the council's procedures. As I indicated in my letter to the committee following the Stage 1 debate, the Government accepted recommendation 4, and as such has tabled this amendment to add a requirement on Welsh Ministers to consult with SPC members before making any revisions to the council's procedures. I therefore ask that the committee accepts this amendment.&nbsp;Turning to the remaining amendments in this group, tabled by Joel James, Members will know that the function of the social partnership council, as set out in the Bill, is to provide information and advice to the Welsh Ministers on relevant matters. It's entirely appropriate that the First Minister, or another Welsh Minister or Deputy Minister, should chair the council. I do therefore not agree with Joel James's proposal that the Senedd be given the power to appoint the chair of the SPC. The council is intended to be a Welsh Government body and not a committee of the Senedd.&nbsp;Amendment 40 would require the SPC to meet four times per year. My view is that this is unnecessarily prescriptive. Currently, the Bill states that the SPC must meet at least three times in each 12-month period. This is a minimum requirement. The SPC may choose to meet more than three times a year if it so wishes, but this would be a matter best decided by the SPC itself when it becomes operational. Amendment 43 would require SPC agendas to be published within a specified period ahead of each meeting. Again, I think this would be unnecessarily restrictive and would hinder the SPC's ability to respond in a flexible and agile way to changing circumstances.&nbsp;Finally, in relation to amendment 48, which relates to members' expenses, all those appointed to public office are bound by the seven principles of public life and have a duty to ensure the safeguarding of public funds. I would expect all members of the SPC or its constituent sub-groups to fully comply with the rules set by the Welsh Government regarding expenses, and that all claims for expenses are scrutinised before payment is made. So, on that basis, while I appreciate the spirit in which that amendment has been tabled, the Government will not be supporting amendment 48, solely on the basis that it isn't necessary.So, in conclusion then, I ask Members to resist amendments 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 48, and support amendment 1. Diolch.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you, Minister. I call on Joel James to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair, and I'm disappointed that the Minister and others are not supporting my amendments in this group. I firmly believe that guaranteeing impartiality, effectiveness and efficiency for these meetings is in the best interests of all involved. Moreover, I do not see any specific need for the First Minister to chair these meetings, because they will still be in attendance, and it helps prevent representatives from simply stating what they think the First Minister wants to hear, which, given the status of the office, as outlined by my colleague Jane Dodds, could easily happen. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 12 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] We will now proceed to a vote on amendment 12. Will all those in favour please raise your hand? And all those against. So, one Member in favour, five against. So, that amendment falls.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel, do you wish to move to amendment 15? Do you wish to put amendment 15?&nbsp;\n\nJoel James MS: Amendment 13?&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, I beg your pardon. So, we\u2014.\n\nRhys Morgan: We move to group 2 now. We'll dispose of these amendments afterwards.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Oh, okay. Sorry. Fine. So, when do we come back to\u2014?\n\nRhys Morgan: In the marshalled order.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. So, the second group of amendments relates to the social partnership council and its political representatives, and the lead amendment in this group is amendment 13. I call on Joel James to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. Turning to my amendments, which comprise the entirety of this group, amendments 13, 17, 19, 21, 26 and 30 serve to increase the political representation on the social partnership council, therefore enabling a wider range of voices to be heard. It also helps improve scrutiny of the Welsh Government, because other political parties would have access to the advice that the Welsh Government is receiving. As to my remaining amendments, 33, 37 and 51, they seek to ensure that those who have been elected to represent the views of the Welsh people are able to represent their constituents in the social partnership council. Thank you.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Does any other Member wish to speak on the amendments in group 2? Sarah.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you, Chair. The social partnership council is not intended to be a political forum; it is meant to be a mechanism for bringing together Welsh Government and social partners in support of the duties set out in the Bill, and, more widely, our well-being goals. So, I do not support this amendment.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Minister, do you wish to\u2014? I beg your pardon. Sorry, I hadn't\u2014. Ken Skates.\n\nKen Skates AM: Thanks, Chair. Further to the comments made by Sarah Murphy, which I agree with, I'd also add that scrutiny of Welsh Government bodies takes place in the Senedd itself, through committee work and Siambr work, not in the bodies themselves, so I'd object to this group as well.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Very good. I call on the Member in charge to respond to the debate.\n\nHannah Blythyn AM: Diolch. The Government will not be accepting these amendments. Our vision for the SPC is as a formal channel through which employers and trade unions\u2014specifically employer and worker representatives\u2014are able to engage with Welsh Ministers, to work with us to reach consensus on issues of mutual interest and to provide us with advice to better inform policy development and support implementation. It's not intended to be a party-political forum, nor, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, some sort of glorified Senedd committee. The Government will therefore not be supporting these amendments.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel James, do you wish to reply to the debate?\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. It's unfortunate, but not surprising, that the Minister and others haven't supported these amendments, but, unless you have voices that represent the diversity of opinion in Wales, it is not really a social partnership. And I'm concerned that the Deputy Minister is going to create an echo chamber for the Welsh Government to hear those opinions that it agrees with. Thank you.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 13 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] Object. So, all those in favour of amendment 13. And all those against. So, that's one in favour, five against, so amendment 13 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: We now move to group 3, which relates to the social partnership council and the employer representatives. The lead amendment is from Joel James\u2014amendment 14.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. I wish to speak to my amendments in this group concerning employer representatives. Firstly, amendments 14 and 20 will increase the number of representatives on the social partnership council, to include representatives of employers from small, medium and large businesses. For the SPC to be properly informed, it must draw on contributions from a wide range of views and experiences. By opening the door to representatives from small, medium and large businesses, we will be ensuring advice and a representative cohort of the private sector will be able to have their say. Small, medium and large businesses each have a different need and organise their voices differently to Government and trade unions. Having one body represent all these businesses is short-sighted, and we should strengthen the ability of businesses to convey their needs, therefore I propose having this extra representation.As to amendments 23 and 24, these will further reinforce the contributions I previously described, by ensuring that employers from different sectors are represented in the SPC. Finally, amendments 49, 50 and 52 provide clear definitions of 'large businesses' et cetera, in order to facilitate my previous amendments.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Does any other Member wish to speak on this group of amendments? The Minister in charge to respond.\n\nHannah Blythyn AM: Thank you, Chair. The Government will not be supporting amendment 14. The SPC is intended to be tripartite, with equal representation from social partners across the public, private and third sectors. Amendment 14 would increase the number of employer representatives on the council, but not worker representatives. This would create an imbalance, and as such is not one we can support.In relation to amendment 23, I am unconvinced that there is a need to give priority status to local health boards and local authorities. The Bill relies on a definition of 'public bodies' set out in section 6 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, all of whom are subject to the social partnership duties, and includes local authorities and local health boards. Making special provision for local health boards and local authorities is therefore unnecessary.&nbsp;As far as amendment 24 is concerned, I believe that ensuring businesses of all sizes are represented in the council is a matter that employer representatives will, without any legal requirement from us, give careful consideration to when making the nominations. And of course we will work with the sector to ensure that this is the case in practice.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: I call on Joel James to reply to the debate.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. Again, it's unfortunate that these amendments are not being supported. I believe that depriving the SPC of the widest possible range of views will only serve to harm its performance in the long run. Thank you.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. The question is that amendment 14 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] Amendment 14, all those in favour. And all those against. One Member in favour, five against, so amendment 14 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 15, Joel James. Do you wish to move this amendment?\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, all those in favour of amendment 15. And all those against. That's one in favour, five against. Amendment 15 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel James, amendment 16\u2014do you wish to move that?\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 16 be agreed to. Does any member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 16. All those against amendment 16. That's one Member in favour, five against. Amendment 16 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel James, amendment 17.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 17 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour. And all those against. So, one in favour, five against. Amendment 17 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 18, Joel James.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 18 be agreed. Does anybody object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 18. And all those against. So, one in favour, five against. Amendment 18 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 19, Joel James.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 19. And all those against. One in favour, five against. Amendment 19 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 20, Joel James.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 20 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 20. And all those against amendment 20. That's one in favour, five against. Amendment 20 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 21.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 21 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 21. And all those against. So, one in favour, five against. Amendment 21 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 22, Joel James.\n\n"}

Are all Members content? Thank you. Well, I note I believe that all Members are content. The clerk, therefore, will now change the settings from public to private, and we will then continue with the meeting.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Bore da. Croeso. Good morning and welcome back to the Public Accounts and Public Administration Committee, meeting this morning remotely. I welcome our guests who'll be giving evidence to committee. I'd be grateful if you could state your names and roles for the record, perhaps starting with Mr Prentice.\n\nPhil Prentice: Hello. My name's Phil Prentice, I'm the chief officer of Scotland's Towns Partnership and the national programme director for Scotland's Improvement Districts.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you very much. And, Mr Roe.\n\nRichard Roe: Good morning, everyone. My name's Richard Roe, I am the corporate director for place at Trafford Council.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you very much indeed. Actually, you're not very far from where I'm sitting at the moment, ironically, albeit across that incredible border.As you'd expect, we have a number of questions, and I would ask both Members and witnesses to be as succinct as possible so that we can cover as wide a range of issues as possible generated by this topic. I will start with the questions to the witnesses. I'll start by asking you to what extent you believe that local authorities in your own jurisdictions are able to effectively create local coalitions of change and bring together all the key players to help regenerate and improve towns. I don't know which of you would like to go first.\n\nPhil Prentice: I'm happy to go first, Mark. I think it's a mixed picture across the country. Some local authorities are very good at this, others less so. So, there genuinely isn't consistency across the piece. But, I would say that, where we see success, it's where local government works very positively with its community and business partnerships and there's trust and an understanding of roles and remits. No one sector is going to be able to fix this problem on its own, and I think there has to be a growing recognition that we do need much more collaboration, but it is a mixed picture.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Would Richard Roe like to comment?\n\nRichard Roe: Yes. I agree with Phil. I think I would say it's a mixed picture. But, if it's going to work, if you're going to successfully regenerate town centres, then it needs the local authority to lead. We are the key player in that role, but the local authority can't do it on its own. So, you do need a coalition with business, with community, with other public sector partners. That's certainly our experience. I think the private sector wants the local authority to step into that space, they want the local authority to take the lead, they want the local authority to create the right environment for investment, and then they will follow. I think the community is the same. I think that has to be the approach. I think, as Phil said, the appetite in different local authorities may not be there.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In the evidence we've received thus far, we've seen local authorities taking the leadership in some towns, but we've also seen town councils, for example, different tiers of local government, taking the lead in other areas, which goes back to the words you referred to in terms of working together and collaboration and partnership. To what extent, from your experience, have you seen local authorities having the right skills with their lead partners in terms of leadership, resources, buy-in and capacity to regenerate towns in the areas where you're working?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll go first, if you don't mind. Again, it's a similar picture. I think local authorities have suffered disproportionately in terms of development departments\u2014economic, housing\u2014through the period of austerity over the last 12 to 15 years. Usually, it's these functions that will have been depleted. That said, I think there's an opportunity here for a regional approach, whereby a lot of those skill sets could be shared across a number of local authorities. In Scotland, we've got a unitary system of 32. We don't have to have specialists in 32 local authorities on housing or finance or net zero; you could actually be doing that at a regional level and driving efficiency. So, we're seeing much more of that through the city and regional growth deals and the regional economic partnerships, particularly in the south of Scotland where we've got a new enterprise agency. They've taken a much more clearly defined role in leading on town-centre regeneration and working more closely with the local authority. So, they're actually bringing the capacity into local government for that period of time, and additional resources, skills and so on. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about structure, so long as the activity is being delivered. But we are facing difficult times around resourcing, so I think there must be more collaboration and a regional approach taken.\n\nRichard Roe: I think there is, undoubtedly, a capacity challenge and a financial challenge, but some of this comes down to prioritisation and the extent to which the authority puts town-centre regeneration as being a priority, and therefore puts resources behind that. I do think there's an opportunity for collaboration. Certainly, within greater Manchester, we do that across the 10 districts and with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, on the basis that that gives us collectively more scope, more buying power. I think there is also scope if you're going to do it with a public, private or community sector partnership, to bring in some of those resources from outside. It doesn't mean the authority has to do everything itself; you can tap into and bring in private sector resources to add in, and that's certainly something that we try and do and push as much as we can.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Have you witnessed or seen any pushback from, say, senior people who don't want to share power in practice, and want to be in charge and carry on in the old way? How's that being managed to get them on board?\n\nRichard Roe: I think there's always some pushback. There are always little power bases. I think the starting point is to get the shared vision. So, certainly, our approach in our town centre\u2014so, in Altrincham and now in Stretford\u2014has been working to get a shared vision, shared ambition, and once you've got that, you've got something you can align behind and that becomes the priority. But that's the starting point.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In terms of the planning system, again, to what extent in your experience do you believe this has been flexible enough to support businesses and partners to respond quickly to problems when they arise, and, if it hasn't, what should be done to improve this? Of course, I'm aware\u2014as obviously, clearly you are\u2014the planning systems in Scotland, Wales and England are not completely aligned, but nonetheless similar issues apply.\n\nPhil Prentice: Again, I'll pitch in from Scotland. We have just published 'National Planning Framework 4', so the new national plan framework has just been approved by the Scottish Parliament. That was actually quite timely because we'd already begun to understand the ongoing trends around it, the decline in retail, and how citizen behaviour had changed, and the urgency around climate. So, a lot of the new policies point towards that. We also have a town-centre policy now called 'A New Future for Scotland's Town Centres', and things that will actually reduce our carbon footprint, that will put more energy back into our town centres, particularly by repopulating and driving residential solutions. So, the planning system, I think, that we have is fit for purpose, and certainly over the last few months, some of the early tests around out-of-town sprawl development have actually been called in by the Scottish Government, and the applications have been refused.So, I think it's important that the Welsh Government gets its story straight, and that there is an alignment within the Welsh Government to make sure there's a consistent approach, because at the end of the day, the planning framework should really encourage the right sort of investment, and we should only be funding the right sort of investment. So, if you get your story straight to begin with, most of the jigsaw pieces will then ultimately fall into place. And all commercial investors want to see is consistency and longevity. They want to know that this is the way it's going to be long term, and the money will then follow up after that. So, I think we have actually got a pretty decent planning system. Obviously, the proof will be in the pudding and the delivery over the next few years, but at least the policy is very solid.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Mr Roe.&nbsp;\n\nRichard Roe: I think I'm probably slightly less optimistic than Phil on this. I think there are some challenges in the planning system. I think it can be slow to get policy changes made. Actually, in our full council last night, we adopted a new planning policy, the civic quarter area action plan, just outside one of our town centres, but it's taken us four years to get that adopted, to go through the system that we have to go through. And we've ended up\u2014. We're adopting it in a very different place from when we started. So, I do think there are some challenges in getting policy and being able to move policy quickly enough to respond to a changing economic environment.&nbsp;I think permitted development rights and the conversion of office to residential gives us some challenges as well, in terms of our ability to manage how that transition&nbsp;from commercial to residential is led, not that we're against bringing more residential into the town centre. That's something that we want to do, but we also want to manage how it works from the commercial basis. You're always recognising in the planning system that you're potentially trying to balance out people with very different interests, and that is always one part of the challenge.Having said that, I think that, used properly, there are some advantages and some strengths in the planning system when you look at individual applications. We have got a neighbourhood business plan in Altrincham, which was worked on and led by the local community, owned by the local community, and they're still very involved with the design panel in looking at development within Altrincham town centre. So, used properly, it can be of benefit, but there are some structural challenges, I think.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: And what, in your view, needs to change to address those?\n\nRichard Roe: I think that some of it is a national-level policy change. The nature of planning is that it takes a long time to do. Within greater Manchester, we're working on a regional strategy now, 'Places for Everyone', across nine of the 10 districts. We've been working on that for seven years now, to get that through. That's a long time to get your baseline planning policy in place. These things are complex, they're large, they're difficult, but there's got to be a way for us to get policy decisions made slightly quicker. Because Phil's right\u2014what the private sector and what the community wants is certainty and understanding. And actually, when you're going through the system, creating planning policy, you're putting uncertainty into the system, and always with the danger that there's a change in national policy, which actually then means that the baseline that you should be working against starts to change.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Again, based upon your experiences, what needs to happen to get other public sector partners, for example health trusts, boards, universities, or otherwise, to work with councils to deliver regeneration in towns?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll pitch in. I think, in Scotland, we've taken a very different approach. We haven't looked at it solely through the prism of town centres\u2014we've looked at it through the prism of place. And through that, we developed a place principle, which was co-signed by local government and the Scottish Government and a number of our key agencies\u2014the likes of enterprise agencies, transport, VisitScotland and the third sector. And the rationale behind that was really that place is the responsibility of all actors, and, ultimately, all actors will have a distinct role to play in actually making the place better, making it work better for citizens, ultimately. And that does involve transportation, it involves health, it involves housing, it involves the environment. But I think that having that discussion at the place-based partnership gives us a much better opportunity to create a holistic vision, and to look at how resources are aligned in the longer term. It even considers disinvestments\u2014an honest discussion about what has to go and what's not affordable any more. So, I think, taking a place-based approach has broadened out the discussion, and no longer is town-centre regeneration seen to be solely the remit of local authorities\u2014it's actually seen to be everybody's responsibility. The principle was launched in 2018, so it's still taking time to embed, but most place partnerships now do involve constituent elements of local authorities\u2014usually being the main driver\u2014but other key community planning partners, particularly health, heritage and economy. And that approach genuinely has widened out and improved the approach to places, which, ultimately, has affected a lot of town centres positively. Because, a wee bit like Wales, Scotland is very much a nation of towns, with the exception of a couple of cities. So, it's where the bulk of our population and businesses reside, and we're need to actually grasp that nettle and just work collegiately to make it better.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. And Richard Roe.\n\n"}

We will adhere to the marshalled list and take each group of amendments relating to that subject matter. I'll obviously call the mover of the lead amendment first and then any other person who wishes to speak, either initially as the mover of another amendment in that group, or any other Member who wishes to speak on the subject in question.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, the first group of amendments relates to the social partnership council chairing, meetings and procedure, and the lead amendment is amendment 12. I call on Joel James to move and speak to the lead amendment and any other amendments in that group.&nbsp;\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair, for this important opportunity to contribute to the Social Partnership and Public Procurement (Wales) Bill. I wish to first of all speak to my own amendments. For the social partnership council to function in a manner that is to be expected, that is, one that shows impartiality and fairness in proceedings, I believe that an independent chair is necessary. For this reason, my amendments in this group will serve to replace the First Minister as chair of the social partnership council with an independent chair that is to be selected by the Senedd.Chair, I also believe that it is important that the meetings of the social partnership council are effective and time efficient. For these reasons, my amendments in this group would also reduce the number of times that the SPC&nbsp;meets, guarantee that the SPC&nbsp;can continue to meet if the chair is not present, and ensure that any expenses claimed as part of participation in the council are reasonable. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of these meetings, amendment 43 will ensure that all meetings will be properly prepared for the meeting by having copies of the agenda for a meeting of the SPC to be published electronically at least 14 days before that meeting, or, if the meeting is convened at a shorter notice, then as soon as is reasonably practicable. As for amendment 1, I'm happy to support this amendment, as I believe it is right that any revisions must be consulted on with the SPC.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Ken. Ken Skates.&nbsp;\n\nKen Skates AM: Thank you, Chair. The SPC is a Welsh Government body. I know of no other Executive bodies that have chairs appointed by the Senedd, so it's entirely appropriate that the First Minister, or for that matter,&nbsp;any other Minister or Deputy Minister within the Government should chair the council. So, I, I'm afraid, don't agree with Joel's proposal.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Anybody else wish to speak on this? Jane.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Thank you, Chair. Thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly on this. I would agree with the point made by my colleague Ken Skates. It feels entirely appropriate that this important council is chaired by somebody with the stature and seniority as that of the First Minister. So, I don't support this amendment. Diolch yn fawr iawn.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: I'd now like to call on the Member in charge to speak to amendment 1, and any other of the amendments in front of us on this subject.&nbsp;\n\nHannah Blythyn AM: Thank you, Chair. I'll speak to the Government's amendment 1 first. This amendment responds to the committee's Stage 1 recommendation No. 4, which proposed that a duty be placed on Welsh Ministers to consult with social partnership council members before making revisions to the council's procedures. As I indicated in my letter to the committee following the Stage 1 debate, the Government accepted recommendation 4, and as such has tabled this amendment to add a requirement on Welsh Ministers to consult with SPC members before making any revisions to the council's procedures. I therefore ask that the committee accepts this amendment.&nbsp;Turning to the remaining amendments in this group, tabled by Joel James, Members will know that the function of the social partnership council, as set out in the Bill, is to provide information and advice to the Welsh Ministers on relevant matters. It's entirely appropriate that the First Minister, or another Welsh Minister or Deputy Minister, should chair the council. I do therefore not agree with Joel James's proposal that the Senedd be given the power to appoint the chair of the SPC. The council is intended to be a Welsh Government body and not a committee of the Senedd.&nbsp;Amendment 40 would require the SPC to meet four times per year. My view is that this is unnecessarily prescriptive. Currently, the Bill states that the SPC must meet at least three times in each 12-month period. This is a minimum requirement. The SPC may choose to meet more than three times a year if it so wishes, but this would be a matter best decided by the SPC itself when it becomes operational. Amendment 43 would require SPC agendas to be published within a specified period ahead of each meeting. Again, I think this would be unnecessarily restrictive and would hinder the SPC's ability to respond in a flexible and agile way to changing circumstances.&nbsp;Finally, in relation to amendment 48, which relates to members' expenses, all those appointed to public office are bound by the seven principles of public life and have a duty to ensure the safeguarding of public funds. I would expect all members of the SPC or its constituent sub-groups to fully comply with the rules set by the Welsh Government regarding expenses, and that all claims for expenses are scrutinised before payment is made. So, on that basis, while I appreciate the spirit in which that amendment has been tabled, the Government will not be supporting amendment 48, solely on the basis that it isn't necessary.So, in conclusion then, I ask Members to resist amendments 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 48, and support amendment 1. Diolch.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you, Minister. I call on Joel James to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair, and I'm disappointed that the Minister and others are not supporting my amendments in this group. I firmly believe that guaranteeing impartiality, effectiveness and efficiency for these meetings is in the best interests of all involved. Moreover, I do not see any specific need for the First Minister to chair these meetings, because they will still be in attendance, and it helps prevent representatives from simply stating what they think the First Minister wants to hear, which, given the status of the office, as outlined by my colleague Jane Dodds, could easily happen. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 12 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] We will now proceed to a vote on amendment 12. Will all those in favour please raise your hand? And all those against. So, one Member in favour, five against. So, that amendment falls.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel, do you wish to move to amendment 15? Do you wish to put amendment 15?&nbsp;\n\nJoel James MS: Amendment 13?&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, I beg your pardon. So, we\u2014.\n\nRhys Morgan: We move to group 2 now. We'll dispose of these amendments afterwards.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Oh, okay. Sorry. Fine. So, when do we come back to\u2014?\n\nRhys Morgan: In the marshalled order.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. So, the second group of amendments relates to the social partnership council and its political representatives, and the lead amendment in this group is amendment 13. I call on Joel James to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. Turning to my amendments, which comprise the entirety of this group, amendments 13, 17, 19, 21, 26 and 30 serve to increase the political representation on the social partnership council, therefore enabling a wider range of voices to be heard. It also helps improve scrutiny of the Welsh Government, because other political parties would have access to the advice that the Welsh Government is receiving. As to my remaining amendments, 33, 37 and 51, they seek to ensure that those who have been elected to represent the views of the Welsh people are able to represent their constituents in the social partnership council. Thank you.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Does any other Member wish to speak on the amendments in group 2? Sarah.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you, Chair. The social partnership council is not intended to be a political forum; it is meant to be a mechanism for bringing together Welsh Government and social partners in support of the duties set out in the Bill, and, more widely, our well-being goals. So, I do not support this amendment.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Minister, do you wish to\u2014? I beg your pardon. Sorry, I hadn't\u2014. Ken Skates.\n\nKen Skates AM: Thanks, Chair. Further to the comments made by Sarah Murphy, which I agree with, I'd also add that scrutiny of Welsh Government bodies takes place in the Senedd itself, through committee work and Siambr work, not in the bodies themselves, so I'd object to this group as well.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Very good. I call on the Member in charge to respond to the debate.\n\nHannah Blythyn AM: Diolch. The Government will not be accepting these amendments. Our vision for the SPC is as a formal channel through which employers and trade unions\u2014specifically employer and worker representatives\u2014are able to engage with Welsh Ministers, to work with us to reach consensus on issues of mutual interest and to provide us with advice to better inform policy development and support implementation. It's not intended to be a party-political forum, nor, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, some sort of glorified Senedd committee. The Government will therefore not be supporting these amendments.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel James, do you wish to reply to the debate?\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. It's unfortunate, but not surprising, that the Minister and others haven't supported these amendments, but, unless you have voices that represent the diversity of opinion in Wales, it is not really a social partnership. And I'm concerned that the Deputy Minister is going to create an echo chamber for the Welsh Government to hear those opinions that it agrees with. Thank you.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 13 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] Object. So, all those in favour of amendment 13. And all those against. So, that's one in favour, five against, so amendment 13 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: We now move to group 3, which relates to the social partnership council and the employer representatives. The lead amendment is from Joel James\u2014amendment 14.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. I wish to speak to my amendments in this group concerning employer representatives. Firstly, amendments 14 and 20 will increase the number of representatives on the social partnership council, to include representatives of employers from small, medium and large businesses. For the SPC to be properly informed, it must draw on contributions from a wide range of views and experiences. By opening the door to representatives from small, medium and large businesses, we will be ensuring advice and a representative cohort of the private sector will be able to have their say. Small, medium and large businesses each have a different need and organise their voices differently to Government and trade unions. Having one body represent all these businesses is short-sighted, and we should strengthen the ability of businesses to convey their needs, therefore I propose having this extra representation.As to amendments 23 and 24, these will further reinforce the contributions I previously described, by ensuring that employers from different sectors are represented in the SPC. Finally, amendments 49, 50 and 52 provide clear definitions of 'large businesses' et cetera, in order to facilitate my previous amendments.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Does any other Member wish to speak on this group of amendments? The Minister in charge to respond.\n\nHannah Blythyn AM: Thank you, Chair. The Government will not be supporting amendment 14. The SPC is intended to be tripartite, with equal representation from social partners across the public, private and third sectors. Amendment 14 would increase the number of employer representatives on the council, but not worker representatives. This would create an imbalance, and as such is not one we can support.In relation to amendment 23, I am unconvinced that there is a need to give priority status to local health boards and local authorities. The Bill relies on a definition of 'public bodies' set out in section 6 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, all of whom are subject to the social partnership duties, and includes local authorities and local health boards. Making special provision for local health boards and local authorities is therefore unnecessary.&nbsp;As far as amendment 24 is concerned, I believe that ensuring businesses of all sizes are represented in the council is a matter that employer representatives will, without any legal requirement from us, give careful consideration to when making the nominations. And of course we will work with the sector to ensure that this is the case in practice.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: I call on Joel James to reply to the debate.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, Chair. Again, it's unfortunate that these amendments are not being supported. I believe that depriving the SPC of the widest possible range of views will only serve to harm its performance in the long run. Thank you.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. The question is that amendment 14 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] Amendment 14, all those in favour. And all those against. One Member in favour, five against, so amendment 14 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 15, Joel James. Do you wish to move this amendment?\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, all those in favour of amendment 15. And all those against. That's one in favour, five against. Amendment 15 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel James, amendment 16\u2014do you wish to move that?\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 16 be agreed to. Does any member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 16. All those against amendment 16. That's one Member in favour, five against. Amendment 16 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Joel James, amendment 17.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 17 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour. And all those against. So, one in favour, five against. Amendment 17 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 18, Joel James.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 18 be agreed. Does anybody object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 18. And all those against. So, one in favour, five against. Amendment 18 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 19, Joel James.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 19. And all those against. One in favour, five against. Amendment 19 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 20, Joel James.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 20 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 20. And all those against amendment 20. That's one in favour, five against. Amendment 20 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 21.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: The question is that amendment 21 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] All those in favour of amendment 21. And all those against. So, one in favour, five against. Amendment 21 falls.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Amendment 22, Joel James.\n\n"}

The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Alun Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAlun Davies AM: 1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the resettlement of people from Ukraine in Wales? OQ59465\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for that question. As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. We continue to support guests, helping them to move on to longer term accommodation, where they can live more settled lives and be supported within local communities.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I'm grateful to the First Minister for that. This afternoon, I think we should also pay tribute to the work of Mick Antoniw, who has united Members across the Chamber in his support for the people of Ukraine over the last period. And the Welsh Government has also, I think, First Minister, demonstrated a real commitment to the people of that country. It has both condemned Putin's illegal invasion, the barbaric war crimes that have been committed against the Ukrainian people, and it has also reached out its hand of friendship to those Ukrainians who are seeking to escape the consequences of Putin's war.&nbsp;In Blaenau Gwent, First Minister, over 130 people have initially been resettled in the county borough. We're also looking at how we can ensure that there is additional support for those people who are seeking to make their homes again in Blaenau Gwent. The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine. Will the First Minister assure me this afternoon that the Welsh Government will continue this support for the people of Ukraine, as we continue to support the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Putin's invasion?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for what he has said about the success of the programme here in Wales. I'm sure Members would want me to recognise as well the part that he has played in making sure that goods from Wales reach families in Ukraine, where war crimes continue to be committed right up to today. I thank the local Member for Blaenau Gwent for what he has said about the success of the scheme in that county borough. It has been a genuinely outstanding success. Workers in Blaenau Gwent local authority's support team have done an outstanding job in helping people from Ukraine, who came first of all to the welcome centre, to be able to move on to longer term accommodation, whether that is within Blaenau Gwent itself, which has welcomed many Ukrainian citizens into that move-on accommodation, or whether it's work with neighbouring local authorities. Indeed, Llywydd, so successful has the Blaenau Gwent team become that we have asked them to take a national lead in assisting other local authorities in that move-on effort, bringing the expertise that they have developed, the operational skills that they have, to support others to do a similar job. And, of course, the Welsh Government, with the \u00a340 million that we have set aside in our budget for the current financial year to continue to welcome people from Ukraine, forced to flee from their own country, looking for an opportunity to re-establish their lives, will go on working with all our partners to make sure that we offer that hand of friendship, live up to our reputation for being a nation of sanctuary, and do everything we can to help people to re-establish their lives here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: In February, Welsh media reported, and I quote, that,'Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward.'And although the Welsh Government stated it was working closely with local councils to get Ukrainian refugees into longer term accommodation, refugees claimed only one in 100 landlords will take a Ukrainian. And, in March, the British Red Cross warned that better infrastructure is needed to support Ukrainians to rebuild their lives in Wales, and that the Welsh Government should work with the UK Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to establish schemes to help Ukrainians into private rented properties by meeting the upfront costs and acting as guarantors where needed. I know the Welsh Government's still awaiting clarification on the \u00a3150 million resettlement funding from UK Government, but what specific action has your Government taken since then to address these findings? And what figures does the Welsh Government have regarding the number of Ukrainians affected and what has happened to them since?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation. Despite the anxieties that were expressed, indeed, over 1,700 Ukrainian guests have already been moved in Wales on to longer term accommodation. And, in terms of the specific actions that have been taken, of the \u00a340 million that I mentioned a moment ago, Llywydd, \u00a34 million of that is specifically to assist our local authority partners in securing additional move-on accommodation, and that does, indeed, cover some of the points that Mark Isherwood made about assisting people who are able to secure somewhere in private accommodation with some of the upfront costs that you face when you're trying to secure places in the private rented sector. At the same time, we have a major transitional accommodation capital programme mobilised through the Welsh Government: over \u00a376 million used last year to assist local authorities and social landlords to deliver more homes to support all those people who are in housing need. That funding has already delivered nearly 1,000 additional homes, and many people from Ukraine have been able to take advantage of that programme. So, we continue to work closely with our partners, Llywydd. Nobody is suggesting that it is easy to find move-on accommodation in what is already a competitive accommodation market, but I think the success story here in Wales is one that would bear up to scrutiny from anyone.&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: 2. What is the Welsh Government doing to ensure that school leavers have the necessary skills to succeed in the employment market? OQ59496\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Careers and work-related experiences are mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales, and Careers Wales provides support for all schools across Wales to build relationships with employers. Qualifications reform and our employability programmes will prepare young people for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: I'm grateful to you, First Minister, for the answer. I ask the question today in the context of equipping our young people with the skills they need to compete in an increasingly globalised world. And, to that end, it's no coincidence that the countries that produce the best outcomes in terms of maths attainment are often also the countries that have emerging and innovative global economies. And in the UK, I think, sometimes, some of us have a tendency to write off the importance of mathematics. People often joke about not being able to do maths, but that's something we'd never say about reading, for example, so that's something I'm glad that the Prime Minister has correctly identified as a problem that makes us less competitive internationally. And he suggested that further maths learning may be required later on in a young person's education to address the problem. Obviously, there are no one-size-fits-all answers here, First Minister, but, given education is devolved in Wales, and, according to the latest Programme for International Student Assessment results, maths attainment in Wales was the worst of the UK nations, what consideration have you given to what the Welsh Government can do to help turn this situation around and to ensure that school leavers have the maths skills that they need so they can reach their full potential? &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I agree with Tom Giffard about the importance of mathematics. Much of what we do in Wales is to equip young people for the digital skills that they will need for the future in which that aspect of the employment market will become more and more important. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions don't match the rhetoric that we hear from him. He was responsible for the catastrophic Multiply programme when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014\u00a3100 million top-sliced out of money that was meant to come to Wales for a national programme that, I'm afraid, has been a huge failure on the ground. Certainly it has not delivered what was promised here in Wales. I'm afraid the Multiply programme just demonstrates the difficulties when Ministers in Whitehall believe that they are able to design things on the ground in parts of the United Kingdom where they have no reach at all. They designed their Multiply programme without a single word of discussion with the Welsh Government or with the local authorities that are expected to deliver it. As a result, it has not been possible to spend the money that was allocated to Wales. That money is yet to be released to local authorities so that they can do useful things with it, including\u2014and I agree with the importance of the point\u2014to improve numeracy amongst people who are leaving school and people in the workplace who are looking to improve their numeracy skills. So, while I agree on the basic proposition, I cannot agree that the way the UK Government has gone about this has demonstrated a success. In fact, I'm afraid, it is exactly the opposite.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Prif Weinidog, Welsh pupils and young people have such a vast array of skills and talents. In terms of future employment, it benefits everyone for there to be a system in place that allows them to access educational opportunities that actually utilise and play to their own strengths, while ensuring they have the skills for jobs. I know the Welsh Government understands this, so, on that note, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the junior apprenticeship programme pilot, and will we see more pupils across Wales be enabled to access such positive opportunities?\n\n"}
{"question": "What specific concern does Joel James MS raise regarding the basic income pilot for young care leavers?", "evidence": " I'm genuinely concerned about the negative ramifications that can happen when people who have adjusted their spending patterns and lifestyle to accommodate extra income suddenly find themselves without it?  ", "options": ["A.  The timing of the pilot's implementation", "B. The effectiveness of basic income as a mechanism", "C. The potential negative ramifications when the pilot ends", "D. The lack of support for young care-experienced parents"], "answer": "C", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the Minister for Social Justice, and the first question is from Russell George.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: 1. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Health and Social Services about ensuring equal access to public toilets for disabled people? OQ59514\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you for your question. I have set up the disability rights taskforce to advance disability rights in Wales. I engaged with all ministerial colleagues to determine the action that needs to be taken in each portfolio area, including access to public toilets for disabled people.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you for your answer, Minister. According to the Great British Public Toilet Map, there are 25 public toilets in Montgomeryshire, in my constituency, but only seven of those are available to those with disabilities. This is really concerning, particularly as there are a lot of people across the county who do have disabilities and need to use a public toilet more than most for various reasons, and they need to have confidence that when they go to a public toilet that there are going to be appropriate facilities for them, not to mention, of course, that Montgomeryshire is a tourism hotspot, at least it is at the moment. And I hope, Minister, you also recognise how important it is in attracting holidaymakers who will also have disabilities. I'm thinking particularly of a project in my constituency. Berriew Community Council, just off the trunk road, are very keen to bring forward facilities for those with disabilities also. But, I wonder what advice you can give in terms of what the Welsh Government can support, because so far they're having real difficulty in attracting the appropriate funds in order to update the facilities.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Russell George. A really important question. We know that a lack of accessible local toilets can limit disabled people's lives, stopping them going out, leading to isolation, anxiety, health conditions, and those are the factors that we need to address. In fact, the Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination not only in the workplace, but in wider society, and we need to promote and deliver on our ambitions to give equal rights and dignity to disabled people in Wales. Now, we have got public toilets provision, and the provision of changing places is moving forward, because\u2014they're not in my portfolio\u2014changes have been made to the building regulations regarding the provision of changing places specifically focused for disabled people. These changes came into force on 3 January.I think your community council would be well advised to engage with the local authority\u2014Powys County Council in this respect\u2014because we also have, under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017, a requirement for each local authority in Wales to produce a local toilet strategy for its area, in consultation with residents and other delivery partners, which would be your community council. It's important, actually, that that Act's provisions are designed to improve toilet provision for everyone and to recognise that, as part of their local toilet strategies, local authorities are required to assess the needs of their communities, including those of disabled people and their carers, and to take steps through the strategy to meet those needs.\n\nJane Dodds MS: 2. Will the Minister provide an update on the learning to date from the care leavers basic income pilot? OQ59510\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much for your question. A comprehensive and detailed resarch strategy is in place to evaluate the basic income pilot, led by Cardiff University, but it is too early to provide data on the impact of the programme. We anticipate being able to publish further monitoring data on the basic income pilot in the autumn.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Thank you so much, Minister. It's pleasing to hear the promising early feedback surrounding the basic income pilot for care leavers, especially comments from you noting that we're already beginning to see the benefits of the scheme. I remember, as well, the motion that I tabled last year, back in July, which called on the Welsh Government to consider how a basic income pilot could be extended to include workers employed in heavy industry\u2014the transition basic income pilot. We've got a legal challenge with Aberpergwm mine ongoing and the announcement this year that Liberty Steel would be letting go of 150 workers from its Newport and Torfaen sites. Therefore, there is a dire need to provide workers with stability and security as these industries change. And the Government is expected to look at their just transition framework for a net-zero Wales in the future. We need to take communities with us and to provide the support that they need. So, could I ask you what conversations you've had, perhaps, across with Ministers for climate change and economy as part of creating a just transition framework on expanding the basic income pilot, following its current iteration, to support workers to transition to green jobs? Diolch.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch, Jane Dodds. And I'd like to thank you for your consistent support for the basic income pilot for our care leavers, with the support you've given since the day we announced it here in the Senedd. I just want to say that the Deputy Minister for Social Services, Julie Morgan, and I met with care leavers at the end of October to discuss the pilot and their experience of it, and learning from them is going to feed into the evaluation. I'm pleased that, of the young people who were eligible in the first six months of the pilot, 92 per cent signed up and were already receiving their monthly payment. And it is important that we link this to your debate and the questions that you've also asked, about updates on this work.In terms of the just transition, you'll be aware, of course, that the Minister for Climate Change took a call for evidence on just transition between last year and 15 March. There has been a good response to that and they're being analysed, so that will come through. And I think what's important to recognise is that the policy drive for our basic income pilot is to support care leavers to make that positive transition from local authority care, using basic income as a means. And, as I've said before, basic income is the mechanism for this, rather than the purpose of the programme, to give care leavers a real chance and opportunity in life. So, I know that we will be able to look at not just the evaluation of the basic income pilot in terms of that use of that mechanism and the impact it has on care leavers, but also how you could look at it in terms, clearly, of the just transition and opportunities there, when we hear from that call for evidence.\n\nJoel James MS: As you will know, Minister, research has continually shown that those who have gone through foster, residential or kinship care are more likely to become parents at a far younger age than others. Indeed, studies in the UK have shown that almost a quarter of young care leavers have children at the point of leaving care, and this proportion increases to almost 50 per cent around two years later, with evidence showing the reasons behind this being the conscious and unconscious seeking of unmet relational and familial needs. I'm extremely supportive that more needs to be done to help those who have gone through the care system, but I still question whether or not a UBI trial is the right way, especially as it has a cliff-edge end to it when the monthly income of \u00a31,600 comes to an end after two years. With this in mind, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the impact that this trial will have on young care-experienced parents and their children when their extra income ends, because I'm genuinely concerned about the negative ramifications that can happen when people who have adjusted their spending patterns and lifestyle to accommodate extra income suddenly find themselves without it? Thank you.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much, Joel James, for that question. I know you will anticipate and, I'm sure, be very interested in the interim results from this Cascade\u2014the Cardiff University Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre\u2014independent evaluation. And this is about seeking to understand the impact of the pilot on the lives of care leavers, and, as you know, it runs until 2026, very much engaging with the views and experiences of young people involved in the pilot. And, of course, we have much engagement support around those young people\u2014local authority stakeholders, Voices from Care Cymru, Citizens Advice partners\u2014helping and supporting our young people in terms of overcoming challenges. But also, just from our experience of meeting with the young people, the scope of their ambition, their interest, their determination for their lives to progress as a result of this opportunity they've been given sets them in very good stead for their future\u2014their whole adult life, I'd say. This is about actually seeing if their whole adult life ahead of them could be transformed by this trust and funding and financial support that we're giving to these young people. Yes, of course, already some of those care-experienced young people who are on the pilot will be in this situation\u2014there will be young parents\u2014and they will move on, as all young people do, into adult life. But I think that's a very useful observation in terms of looking at their experience.Can I just say that 50 per cent of young people enrolled have responded to the Your Life Beyond Care survey? That's a really important survey. Obviously, the Deputy Minister for Social Services is responsible for care leavers and care-experienced young people, and I'm delighted that the First Minister launched, with a number of Ministers, the declaration that came from care-experienced young people. And I do urge the Member, and all Members, to look at that declaration, because that declaration came from work that they did themselves\u2014young people\u2014to tell us in Government how they felt we could do better, at local authority and at Welsh Government level, in supporting care leavers at every stage of their young lives.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: It will be no surprise to hear that Plaid Cymru is in favour of the care leavers basic income pilot, and there's pleasure that the pilot is ongoing. That has been replaced by disgust at some of the ways that Tory Members across the floor from me have twisted this policy. To those who are peddling dog-whistle politics reminiscent of Trump, I say this, 'You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.'Minister, I'd like to see the timescale set out by the Government, so that when the results of this trial come back\u2014and I anticipate that they will be positive\u2014there are clear markers rolled out, so that extensive basic income can continue. We cannot afford to let a scheme that could be as transformational as this to drift into the ether.&nbsp;\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Peredur, and such an important question. I'm reluctant to go back\u2014but I will do\u2014to say how shocked we were by this attack on our basic income pilot, which came from ill-informed, inaccurate and misleading information that came from the Conservatives. We are clear about that. It wanted to undermine what we were doing, but, most of all, undermine those young people who are most vulnerable in our nation of sanctuary\u2014our unaccompanied asylum seeker children, who have always been included as eligible. And can I put that on the record again for the basic income pilot? As category 3 care leavers\u2014. I have to say to everyone here, you have all got young people, care leavers, in this pilot. Every single local authority in this Chamber has got care leavers in this pilot. Remember that. And they are, I'm sure, wanting to ensure that we are backing them as they go through this important pilot and, of course, as I've said, the comprehensive detailed research and publishing further monitoring data later on this year.But also, just to say, as to those young people we are supporting, we will want, as you have described very clearly, to support them through every entitlement that they have\u2014every entitlement that they have. And that includes a right to claim asylum in the UK.&nbsp;So, I hope we can move on from that, but also, just to say, as far as our care leavers and care-experienced young people are concerned, they are listening and watching what we are saying in this Chamber, backing them in their prospects\u2014and there are prospects\u2014for their life chances and life opportunities.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Mark Isherwood.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Diolch, Llywydd. Your ministerial responsibilities, as you know, include co-ordination of cross-cutting measures to promote prosperity and tackle poverty. Speaking here last October in the debate on a Member's legislative proposal for a take-up of benefits Bill, I challenged the Welsh Government on the actions it had taken to establish a coherent and integrated Welsh benefits system for all the means-tested benefits it is responsible for, as recommended in the 2019 committee report on benefits in Wales. Last month's Bevan Foundation report on a common approach to Welsh benefits stated that they have long called for a single framework of grants and allowances termed a 'Welsh benefits system', that this system would remove the complex and confusing application process and has the potential to lift people out of poverty. Their findings demonstrate that establishing a Welsh benefits system is feasible in terms of data, that millions of pounds of unclaimed benefits could support those on low incomes, and that the regulations governing Welsh benefits are set by a Welsh Government and so it's within their power to introduce regulatory amendment to facilitate greater uniformity.&nbsp;How do you therefore respond to these findings, and what action are you now taking further to the debate last year and to the report last month? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\n"}

Welcome, Minister, and welcome to your officials, Emma Williams, the director for housing and regeneration, and Dean Medcraft, director of finance and operations. Okay, Minister, we'd better move swiftly on. Let me begin, then, with a general question: to what extent has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 shaped the budget allocations within the climate change portfolio, and how has the Government's commitment to that Act been balanced with the need to address present-day cost-of-living and other pressures?\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Chair. There's no doubt at all that we're facing one of the most difficult and challenging budget settlements in Wales that we've ever faced as a result of choices made elsewhere. Inflation has also eroded our budget to worryingly low levels, and local authorities and NHS organisations are reporting significant shortfalls in funding as a result of the inflationary increases, the pay pressures, and, of course, the rising energy costs. So, there's no getting away from the fact that this has required us to make really, really difficult choices, and the UK Government has just failed to address the significant funding gap that should have uplifted our budgets in line with inflation in order to maintain the vital public services that we all rely on. So, the reality is that we could not meet all the pressures identified to support cost-of-living interventions within the funding available.But, despite that, we always maintain our approach rooted in the well-being of future generations Act, so we've undertaken to maximise the impact of the available resources that we do have, balancing our short-term needs with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and trying to make the longer term change and delivery that we want for our programme for government ambitions, including tackling poverty. This has resulted in the Government, across the Government, undertaking an exercise to review all of our budgets and prioritise our support where it was needed most, building on the actions that we already outlined as part of the spending review last year. I'm sure that the Chair is aware that the budget round this year has been supported by the work of the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee, which I'm a core member of.The result of that was that we put additional allocations into the discretionary assistance fund, homelessness services and the pupil development grant\u2014[<em>Interruption.</em>] Excuse me, Chair. The cost-of-living crisis and its impact on household budgets means that many people have been unable to pay their rent or other household bills, and, for my portfolio, the risk of them falling into rent arrears and subsequently facing eviction is a real, real concern. We do not want to push individuals towards seeking homelessness support from the local authority; we want them to go into homelessness prevention support, and we want to try to keep people in their homes where at all possible. I'm sure, Chair, that you'll remember from previous sessions with me, and I'm sure you've had evidence from elsewhere, that we continue to have very high levels of presentations for homelessness services right across Wales. So, I'm pleased to say that we have managed to find an additional allocation of \u00a310 million to put into the homelessness budget and to maintain our 'no-one left out' approach to be sure that no-one is forced to sleep rough. The additional funding is going to go into homelessness prevention measures, including where it cannot be prevented to meet the costs of temporary accommodation.I'm sure that the committee is also aware that we've had absolutely no funding commitment from the UK Government for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We funded our supersponsor scheme, including accommodation and wraparound support using funding from Welsh Government reserves, and we continue to support people arriving from Ukraine. We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales. We've committed \u00a320 million to supporting our Ukrainian humanitarian response as well, and that's to ensure that our really hard-pressed local authorities are able to continue offering the services that we've put in place.And then, Chair, I think what I really want the committee to understand is that, obviously, the part that you're looking at from my budget is part of a much bigger MEG, as we call it\u2014the main expenditure group. And so, we've had to look across right across the MEG to balance out how to get through the pain of this budget, and that's the word that has to be used. It's been a really, really, really difficult thing to do, and we've had to look at an enormous number of things that are essential to be able to push our progressive plans forward.So, we continue to outline a vision and our short and medium-term plans, including preventative plans, to push forward the reform. So, we continue, for example, to resource putting our homelessness legislation onto the statute book; we continue to look at embedding the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ways of working across the piece, including transparency and impact reform; we also continue to try to maintain the longer term strategies that we have for things like decarbonisation, for retrofit, and so on, balanced with the real sharp-point crisis that we've been facing and trying to move the money around, so that we're both helping people in the here and now, but also not making it worse for people later on because we've moved that money around. There's no getting away from the fact that it's been a real, real challenge to do so, and, as I say, we've had to look right across the whole expenditure group to do that, and the money has been moved accordingly in an attempt to do that. I'll leave it there. I'm sure that you'll get into some of the specifics, but I want the committee to fully understand the sheer scale of the budget process that we've been going through in order to try and squeeze some of this cost-of-living money out of the budget.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Okay, Minister. Thank you very much for that overview and, as you say, we'll be coming on to many of those matters with subsequent questions. Firstly, Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister and members of your office. May I apologise that I can't be there in person? I have personal reasons that mean that I am stuck here in north Wales at the moment. Minister, you mentioned in your opening statement about homelessness. Just in general on that point, do you feel that homelessness services and support services for homelessness are being prioritised in this budget?\n\nJulie James AM: Diolch, Mabon. Yes, absolutely. So, the data shows clearly that demand is increasing. I've just said in my opening remarks that we know that the pressure on homelessness services across Wales hasn't abated and, in some places, has actually increased. We also know that the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing are adding to the drivers that drive people into home loss. We also know that prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address homelessness. So, we're not going to row back on our 'no-one left out' policy, despite the real serious pressures that we've facing. So, recognising those pressures, the prevention budget will increase by \u00a350 million in 2023-24, an additional \u00a310 million more than previously planned, and that takes our investment in homelessness and housing support to over \u00a3207 million next year.&nbsp;In recognition of the support services required to keep people in their homes as well, we increased the housing support grant budget by \u00a340 million in 2021-22 to \u00a3166.763 million, which is a 30 per cent rise. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the incredibly difficult budget pressure that we've had this year\u2014and it has been incredibly difficult\u2014we have managed to maintain that substantial increase in this year's budget, and then going forward into the 2023-24 budget. So, the answer, I suppose, in a nutshell is that there is obviously more that we could do; there's always going to be more we can do in the face of the current cost-of-living pressure. But, I'm very pleased that we've managed to maintain services at the increased level that we were able to put them in, and we've just managed to get another \u00a310 million into homelessness services themselves. We continue to scrutinise the budget every day, I assure you, looking for extra ways to increase money into this essential service.&nbsp;\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Minister, for that response. If I may go to the narrative of the draft budget as I read it and as we saw it back in December, in that narrative, it mentions the effect of low pay and cost of living on the front-line staff of homelessness services. There was an example that 44 per cent of the workforce were unable to pay bills, that 11 per cent of them were unable to pay rent, et cetera. But, this, again, this year, is a flat settlement, compared to\u2014. I accept that you say that you've increased it in previous years, but in the last year, we've seen huge inflation, so this settlement, which is flat, is a real-terms cut in the settlement, which means that we will then see more of the front-line workforce leaving their jobs, and then more pressure on services. So, in considering the targets that we have\u2014you've mentioned some of them\u2014and the fact that we're likely to see more of that workforce leave and unable to do their work, and additional pressure, do you feel that this settlement is fair for that sector in particular?&nbsp;And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you\u2019re putting towards these services that are provided is enough? [Translation should read: And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you're providing is able to go towards these services that are provided by front-line staff?]&nbsp;\n\n"}

We know, obviously, that anybody with children, anybody with a disability, and also private renters whose housing benefit isn't covering the cost of their rent, are in a desperate situation.

", "options": ["A. disabled people", "B. homeless people", "C. families without children", "D. older people"], "answer": "C", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: So, I'd very much like to welcome Sarah Germain, who is the chief executive officer of FareShare, as well as Jen Griffiths, the service manager for Flintshire County Council, and Robbie Davison, in charge of Well Fed. So, welcome to all of you.In light of the fact the Trussell Trust isn't here with us today, I did notice in its evidence that there had been a sort of drop-off in the demand for food, marginally, in the month of July, when there was a cost-of-living payment made by the UK Government, but that it was then back up to really high levels again in August. I just wondered if you could, very briefly, just summarise what the current situation is, given that we have got your written evidence in all cases. Just how difficult is it for organisations that are endeavouring to ensure that everybody is eating and heating?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: I can start, if you like. So, the demand just isn't going away. It's going up, if anything. As an organisation ourselves that supports other organisations, we are finding that we are getting more and more requests for support. In addition, the organisations that we are working with are also asking for more food. So, the organisations that we are already working with are asking for more food, and we are always having more organisations asking us for food as well.FareShare UK did a survey back in September-October time, and it found that 96 per cent of our community food members in south Wales were saying that they had had an increase in demand since January the previous year. So, that shows that almost every organisation that we are working with has seen that increase in demand.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, are people actually being turned away?\n\nSarah Germain: I don't know if people are being turned away. I know that we, and they, are finding it difficult to meet the demand that is there, and that demand is growing constantly.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Who are the main people who are using these services? We know, obviously, that anybody with children, anybody with a disability, and also private renters whose housing benefit isn't covering the cost of their rent, are in a desperate situation. Is that a reasonable summary of who you are seeing?\n\nSarah Germain: I think that it's across the board. There are all sorts of organisations. We work with all sorts of organisations. We work with everyone from homeless hostels, women's refuges, through to pantries and community kitchens. So, we work with a whole host of organisations, and I think that demand is going up across the board. But the highest levels of demand are within groups\u2014. The highest demand groups are families with children, older people and lone parents. Those are the three highest groups that our community groups are saying that that they've seen an increase in demand from.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Robbie Davison or Jen Griffiths.\n\nRobbie Davison: I'd just add that there's a kind of new poverty going on. I don't know if I put in the evidence that we've submitted that we are noticing about a 20 per cent increase in people wanting good food services. What's been interesting, and almost alarming at the same time, is that there are people now coming through the system who have never been in need of food aid or, if you like, poverty services at all. Therefore, they don't know what to do while they are in them. So, for the first time, they are trying to make do with maybe visits to a food bank, maybe visits to a pantry, maybe relying on services like us. But, because it's the first time that they have been involved, they've needed to get involved in services like ours and others. The issue for them, when you're talking to them and you're meeting them for the first time, is that there's a panic\u2014there's a real panic\u2014that they don't know what to do next because they've never been in the situation before. That's coming through now.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, thank you. Jen Griffiths.&nbsp;\n\nJen Griffiths: Thank you. Flintshire is fairly rural. We've got lots of communities that don't have access to the main town centres\u2014we've got five county towns in Flintshire. And what we are noticing, as Robbie's just said, it's people who've never accessed the system. So, we've got support hubs where we offer advice and guidance, but people are coming in who won't access the benefits system because they wouldn't qualify and they don't meet those criteria. However, they're really struggling to pay their bills. It's eat or heat, feed your children or feed yourself, and it's almost like there's a squeezed middle who are missed by the benefits system because they simply wouldn't qualify. However, because of the cost of living, they're just really struggling to cope, and it's certainly something we've seen through our hub models in Flintshire. People we've never bumped into before are accessing services and trying to find ways to alleviate their situation.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Given that there is clearly so much need, how are organisations managing to meet that need? Sarah, you said that you weren't aware of anybody being turned away, but if the public doesn't support your organisations, then the situation could become a whole lot worse, couldn't it?\n\nSarah Germain: Yes, I think they are feeling it\u2014the organisations that are supporting people that are in this situation are starting to feel it themselves. They stepped up to the plate during the pandemic, they've been working really hard all the way through the pandemic to help through that, and then straight off the back of that we're into this cost-of-living crisis. So, I think the organisations are finding it hard. They are feeling that demand. I've got some stats somewhere if I can just find them. They're being hit by the cost-of-living crisis themselves as well, because obviously their bills are going up, the cost of food is going up, wages are starting to go up as well, so the organisations themselves are starting to feel the impact of this as an organisation as well.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Robbie.\n\nRobbie Davison: It's interesting, because the pressure on, if you like, the third sector is continuing to grow and increase, and it's important to note that. What we've been attempting to do as an organisation is\u2014. We have got a completely different model. We've got a commercial model running alongside a social model, and we are trying desperately to move people away from charity alone and to get them to be contributors to their own well-being. And by that I mean we offer four weeks' worth of support that is free to access, which is meals for a week, but after four weeks we start to charge. But we start to charge at a subsidised rate. So, for four weeks, we charge \u00a310 and people get \u00a340 worth of food, and then for the following four weeks\u2014so, it's 12 weeks in total\u2014they pay \u00a315. The reason this is important is because we are using our profits to subsidise the food, but what we are actually asking people to do is to take part in looking after themselves, moving them away from an over-reliance on charity and getting them back into thinking about their own well-being, at a cost that they can afford. Really, really important\u2014good food has to be affordable, otherwise good food will just not be on offer to people.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Sioned Williams wanted to follow up on one of your comments. Sioned.\n\nSioned Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to follow up on a comment made by Sarah from FareShare regarding the increase in demand. In the written evidence, 75 institutions on the waiting list and 42 organisations\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014in specific areas of Wales\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\n\nSarah Germain: Those groups are primarily in south-east Wales, because that's where the majority of our members are. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Sorry.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Sorry, Sarah. We just have to take a halt for a moment because we've lost Sioned. Are you able to hear what Sarah Germain's starting to say?&nbsp;\n\nSioned Williams MS: Yes, I can hear.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Excellent. We lost you momentarily. Sarah, please do continue.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Chair, sorry. Could I just raise a point, which is that I'm having a problem hearing Rob's microphone? I'm not sure if anybody else is having a problem with that microphone.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Well, I think the technicians can raise the volume on that mike.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: There is a red light here and it's just gone\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: No, don't touch\u2014\n\nRobbie Davison: I won't touch it.\n\nSarah Germain: I think that means you're on.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Okay.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Can you hear Robbie now, Jane?&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Can you hear me? Great.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, that's fine. Sarah, back to you.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: Yes. So, those 75 organisations are across south-east Wales, because that's the majority of where we are. There is another waiting list in north Wales of about 10 organisations up there, and they're across the board. Yes, that's where the\u2014. Yes.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Thank you. I saw Jane next, I think, and then Altaf.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Yes, I just wanted to ask what's the main reason that adults approach you. We've heard that pensioners and single parents do access your services, but what are the main reasons? Is it because they're on benefits or because they're not being paid enough in employment to afford food? What's the main reason? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\n"}
{"question": "What is the situation of Ukrainian refugees on housing in Wales?", "evidence": "  Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation.

The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Alun Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAlun Davies AM: 1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the resettlement of people from Ukraine in Wales? OQ59465\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for that question. As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. We continue to support guests, helping them to move on to longer term accommodation, where they can live more settled lives and be supported within local communities.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I'm grateful to the First Minister for that. This afternoon, I think we should also pay tribute to the work of Mick Antoniw, who has united Members across the Chamber in his support for the people of Ukraine over the last period. And the Welsh Government has also, I think, First Minister, demonstrated a real commitment to the people of that country. It has both condemned Putin's illegal invasion, the barbaric war crimes that have been committed against the Ukrainian people, and it has also reached out its hand of friendship to those Ukrainians who are seeking to escape the consequences of Putin's war.&nbsp;In Blaenau Gwent, First Minister, over 130 people have initially been resettled in the county borough. We're also looking at how we can ensure that there is additional support for those people who are seeking to make their homes again in Blaenau Gwent. The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine. Will the First Minister assure me this afternoon that the Welsh Government will continue this support for the people of Ukraine, as we continue to support the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Putin's invasion?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for what he has said about the success of the programme here in Wales. I'm sure Members would want me to recognise as well the part that he has played in making sure that goods from Wales reach families in Ukraine, where war crimes continue to be committed right up to today. I thank the local Member for Blaenau Gwent for what he has said about the success of the scheme in that county borough. It has been a genuinely outstanding success. Workers in Blaenau Gwent local authority's support team have done an outstanding job in helping people from Ukraine, who came first of all to the welcome centre, to be able to move on to longer term accommodation, whether that is within Blaenau Gwent itself, which has welcomed many Ukrainian citizens into that move-on accommodation, or whether it's work with neighbouring local authorities. Indeed, Llywydd, so successful has the Blaenau Gwent team become that we have asked them to take a national lead in assisting other local authorities in that move-on effort, bringing the expertise that they have developed, the operational skills that they have, to support others to do a similar job. And, of course, the Welsh Government, with the \u00a340 million that we have set aside in our budget for the current financial year to continue to welcome people from Ukraine, forced to flee from their own country, looking for an opportunity to re-establish their lives, will go on working with all our partners to make sure that we offer that hand of friendship, live up to our reputation for being a nation of sanctuary, and do everything we can to help people to re-establish their lives here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: In February, Welsh media reported, and I quote, that,'Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward.'And although the Welsh Government stated it was working closely with local councils to get Ukrainian refugees into longer term accommodation, refugees claimed only one in 100 landlords will take a Ukrainian. And, in March, the British Red Cross warned that better infrastructure is needed to support Ukrainians to rebuild their lives in Wales, and that the Welsh Government should work with the UK Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to establish schemes to help Ukrainians into private rented properties by meeting the upfront costs and acting as guarantors where needed. I know the Welsh Government's still awaiting clarification on the \u00a3150 million resettlement funding from UK Government, but what specific action has your Government taken since then to address these findings? And what figures does the Welsh Government have regarding the number of Ukrainians affected and what has happened to them since?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation. Despite the anxieties that were expressed, indeed, over 1,700 Ukrainian guests have already been moved in Wales on to longer term accommodation. And, in terms of the specific actions that have been taken, of the \u00a340 million that I mentioned a moment ago, Llywydd, \u00a34 million of that is specifically to assist our local authority partners in securing additional move-on accommodation, and that does, indeed, cover some of the points that Mark Isherwood made about assisting people who are able to secure somewhere in private accommodation with some of the upfront costs that you face when you're trying to secure places in the private rented sector. At the same time, we have a major transitional accommodation capital programme mobilised through the Welsh Government: over \u00a376 million used last year to assist local authorities and social landlords to deliver more homes to support all those people who are in housing need. That funding has already delivered nearly 1,000 additional homes, and many people from Ukraine have been able to take advantage of that programme. So, we continue to work closely with our partners, Llywydd. Nobody is suggesting that it is easy to find move-on accommodation in what is already a competitive accommodation market, but I think the success story here in Wales is one that would bear up to scrutiny from anyone.&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: 2. What is the Welsh Government doing to ensure that school leavers have the necessary skills to succeed in the employment market? OQ59496\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Careers and work-related experiences are mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales, and Careers Wales provides support for all schools across Wales to build relationships with employers. Qualifications reform and our employability programmes will prepare young people for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: I'm grateful to you, First Minister, for the answer. I ask the question today in the context of equipping our young people with the skills they need to compete in an increasingly globalised world. And, to that end, it's no coincidence that the countries that produce the best outcomes in terms of maths attainment are often also the countries that have emerging and innovative global economies. And in the UK, I think, sometimes, some of us have a tendency to write off the importance of mathematics. People often joke about not being able to do maths, but that's something we'd never say about reading, for example, so that's something I'm glad that the Prime Minister has correctly identified as a problem that makes us less competitive internationally. And he suggested that further maths learning may be required later on in a young person's education to address the problem. Obviously, there are no one-size-fits-all answers here, First Minister, but, given education is devolved in Wales, and, according to the latest Programme for International Student Assessment results, maths attainment in Wales was the worst of the UK nations, what consideration have you given to what the Welsh Government can do to help turn this situation around and to ensure that school leavers have the maths skills that they need so they can reach their full potential? &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I agree with Tom Giffard about the importance of mathematics. Much of what we do in Wales is to equip young people for the digital skills that they will need for the future in which that aspect of the employment market will become more and more important. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions don't match the rhetoric that we hear from him. He was responsible for the catastrophic Multiply programme when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014\u00a3100 million top-sliced out of money that was meant to come to Wales for a national programme that, I'm afraid, has been a huge failure on the ground. Certainly it has not delivered what was promised here in Wales. I'm afraid the Multiply programme just demonstrates the difficulties when Ministers in Whitehall believe that they are able to design things on the ground in parts of the United Kingdom where they have no reach at all. They designed their Multiply programme without a single word of discussion with the Welsh Government or with the local authorities that are expected to deliver it. As a result, it has not been possible to spend the money that was allocated to Wales. That money is yet to be released to local authorities so that they can do useful things with it, including\u2014and I agree with the importance of the point\u2014to improve numeracy amongst people who are leaving school and people in the workplace who are looking to improve their numeracy skills. So, while I agree on the basic proposition, I cannot agree that the way the UK Government has gone about this has demonstrated a success. In fact, I'm afraid, it is exactly the opposite.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Prif Weinidog, Welsh pupils and young people have such a vast array of skills and talents. In terms of future employment, it benefits everyone for there to be a system in place that allows them to access educational opportunities that actually utilise and play to their own strengths, while ensuring they have the skills for jobs. I know the Welsh Government understands this, so, on that note, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the junior apprenticeship programme pilot, and will we see more pupils across Wales be enabled to access such positive opportunities?\n\n"}

Welcome, Minister, and welcome to your officials, Emma Williams, the director for housing and regeneration, and Dean Medcraft, director of finance and operations. Okay, Minister, we'd better move swiftly on. Let me begin, then, with a general question: to what extent has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 shaped the budget allocations within the climate change portfolio, and how has the Government's commitment to that Act been balanced with the need to address present-day cost-of-living and other pressures?\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Chair. There's no doubt at all that we're facing one of the most difficult and challenging budget settlements in Wales that we've ever faced as a result of choices made elsewhere. Inflation has also eroded our budget to worryingly low levels, and local authorities and NHS organisations are reporting significant shortfalls in funding as a result of the inflationary increases, the pay pressures, and, of course, the rising energy costs. So, there's no getting away from the fact that this has required us to make really, really difficult choices, and the UK Government has just failed to address the significant funding gap that should have uplifted our budgets in line with inflation in order to maintain the vital public services that we all rely on. So, the reality is that we could not meet all the pressures identified to support cost-of-living interventions within the funding available.But, despite that, we always maintain our approach rooted in the well-being of future generations Act, so we've undertaken to maximise the impact of the available resources that we do have, balancing our short-term needs with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and trying to make the longer term change and delivery that we want for our programme for government ambitions, including tackling poverty. This has resulted in the Government, across the Government, undertaking an exercise to review all of our budgets and prioritise our support where it was needed most, building on the actions that we already outlined as part of the spending review last year. I'm sure that the Chair is aware that the budget round this year has been supported by the work of the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee, which I'm a core member of.The result of that was that we put additional allocations into the discretionary assistance fund, homelessness services and the pupil development grant\u2014[<em>Interruption.</em>] Excuse me, Chair. The cost-of-living crisis and its impact on household budgets means that many people have been unable to pay their rent or other household bills, and, for my portfolio, the risk of them falling into rent arrears and subsequently facing eviction is a real, real concern. We do not want to push individuals towards seeking homelessness support from the local authority; we want them to go into homelessness prevention support, and we want to try to keep people in their homes where at all possible. I'm sure, Chair, that you'll remember from previous sessions with me, and I'm sure you've had evidence from elsewhere, that we continue to have very high levels of presentations for homelessness services right across Wales. So, I'm pleased to say that we have managed to find an additional allocation of \u00a310 million to put into the homelessness budget and to maintain our 'no-one left out' approach to be sure that no-one is forced to sleep rough. The additional funding is going to go into homelessness prevention measures, including where it cannot be prevented to meet the costs of temporary accommodation.I'm sure that the committee is also aware that we've had absolutely no funding commitment from the UK Government for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We funded our supersponsor scheme, including accommodation and wraparound support using funding from Welsh Government reserves, and we continue to support people arriving from Ukraine. We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales. We've committed \u00a320 million to supporting our Ukrainian humanitarian response as well, and that's to ensure that our really hard-pressed local authorities are able to continue offering the services that we've put in place.And then, Chair, I think what I really want the committee to understand is that, obviously, the part that you're looking at from my budget is part of a much bigger MEG, as we call it\u2014the main expenditure group. And so, we've had to look across right across the MEG to balance out how to get through the pain of this budget, and that's the word that has to be used. It's been a really, really, really difficult thing to do, and we've had to look at an enormous number of things that are essential to be able to push our progressive plans forward.So, we continue to outline a vision and our short and medium-term plans, including preventative plans, to push forward the reform. So, we continue, for example, to resource putting our homelessness legislation onto the statute book; we continue to look at embedding the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ways of working across the piece, including transparency and impact reform; we also continue to try to maintain the longer term strategies that we have for things like decarbonisation, for retrofit, and so on, balanced with the real sharp-point crisis that we've been facing and trying to move the money around, so that we're both helping people in the here and now, but also not making it worse for people later on because we've moved that money around. There's no getting away from the fact that it's been a real, real challenge to do so, and, as I say, we've had to look right across the whole expenditure group to do that, and the money has been moved accordingly in an attempt to do that. I'll leave it there. I'm sure that you'll get into some of the specifics, but I want the committee to fully understand the sheer scale of the budget process that we've been going through in order to try and squeeze some of this cost-of-living money out of the budget.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Okay, Minister. Thank you very much for that overview and, as you say, we'll be coming on to many of those matters with subsequent questions. Firstly, Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister and members of your office. May I apologise that I can't be there in person? I have personal reasons that mean that I am stuck here in north Wales at the moment. Minister, you mentioned in your opening statement about homelessness. Just in general on that point, do you feel that homelessness services and support services for homelessness are being prioritised in this budget?\n\nJulie James AM: Diolch, Mabon. Yes, absolutely. So, the data shows clearly that demand is increasing. I've just said in my opening remarks that we know that the pressure on homelessness services across Wales hasn't abated and, in some places, has actually increased. We also know that the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing are adding to the drivers that drive people into home loss. We also know that prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address homelessness. So, we're not going to row back on our 'no-one left out' policy, despite the real serious pressures that we've facing. So, recognising those pressures, the prevention budget will increase by \u00a350 million in 2023-24, an additional \u00a310 million more than previously planned, and that takes our investment in homelessness and housing support to over \u00a3207 million next year.&nbsp;In recognition of the support services required to keep people in their homes as well, we increased the housing support grant budget by \u00a340 million in 2021-22 to \u00a3166.763 million, which is a 30 per cent rise. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the incredibly difficult budget pressure that we've had this year\u2014and it has been incredibly difficult\u2014we have managed to maintain that substantial increase in this year's budget, and then going forward into the 2023-24 budget. So, the answer, I suppose, in a nutshell is that there is obviously more that we could do; there's always going to be more we can do in the face of the current cost-of-living pressure. But, I'm very pleased that we've managed to maintain services at the increased level that we were able to put them in, and we've just managed to get another \u00a310 million into homelessness services themselves. We continue to scrutinise the budget every day, I assure you, looking for extra ways to increase money into this essential service.&nbsp;\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Minister, for that response. If I may go to the narrative of the draft budget as I read it and as we saw it back in December, in that narrative, it mentions the effect of low pay and cost of living on the front-line staff of homelessness services. There was an example that 44 per cent of the workforce were unable to pay bills, that 11 per cent of them were unable to pay rent, et cetera. But, this, again, this year, is a flat settlement, compared to\u2014. I accept that you say that you've increased it in previous years, but in the last year, we've seen huge inflation, so this settlement, which is flat, is a real-terms cut in the settlement, which means that we will then see more of the front-line workforce leaving their jobs, and then more pressure on services. So, in considering the targets that we have\u2014you've mentioned some of them\u2014and the fact that we're likely to see more of that workforce leave and unable to do their work, and additional pressure, do you feel that this settlement is fair for that sector in particular?&nbsp;And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you\u2019re putting towards these services that are provided is enough? [Translation should read: And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you're providing is able to go towards these services that are provided by front-line staff?]&nbsp;\n\n"}

Some people struggle to live like a squeezed middle and are missed by the benefits system because they simply wouldn't qualify."], "answer": "D", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: So, I'd very much like to welcome Sarah Germain, who is the chief executive officer of FareShare, as well as Jen Griffiths, the service manager for Flintshire County Council, and Robbie Davison, in charge of Well Fed. So, welcome to all of you.In light of the fact the Trussell Trust isn't here with us today, I did notice in its evidence that there had been a sort of drop-off in the demand for food, marginally, in the month of July, when there was a cost-of-living payment made by the UK Government, but that it was then back up to really high levels again in August. I just wondered if you could, very briefly, just summarise what the current situation is, given that we have got your written evidence in all cases. Just how difficult is it for organisations that are endeavouring to ensure that everybody is eating and heating?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: I can start, if you like. So, the demand just isn't going away. It's going up, if anything. As an organisation ourselves that supports other organisations, we are finding that we are getting more and more requests for support. In addition, the organisations that we are working with are also asking for more food. So, the organisations that we are already working with are asking for more food, and we are always having more organisations asking us for food as well.FareShare UK did a survey back in September-October time, and it found that 96 per cent of our community food members in south Wales were saying that they had had an increase in demand since January the previous year. So, that shows that almost every organisation that we are working with has seen that increase in demand.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, are people actually being turned away?\n\nSarah Germain: I don't know if people are being turned away. I know that we, and they, are finding it difficult to meet the demand that is there, and that demand is growing constantly.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Who are the main people who are using these services? We know, obviously, that anybody with children, anybody with a disability, and also private renters whose housing benefit isn't covering the cost of their rent, are in a desperate situation. Is that a reasonable summary of who you are seeing?\n\nSarah Germain: I think that it's across the board. There are all sorts of organisations. We work with all sorts of organisations. We work with everyone from homeless hostels, women's refuges, through to pantries and community kitchens. So, we work with a whole host of organisations, and I think that demand is going up across the board. But the highest levels of demand are within groups\u2014. The highest demand groups are families with children, older people and lone parents. Those are the three highest groups that our community groups are saying that that they've seen an increase in demand from.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Robbie Davison or Jen Griffiths.\n\nRobbie Davison: I'd just add that there's a kind of new poverty going on. I don't know if I put in the evidence that we've submitted that we are noticing about a 20 per cent increase in people wanting good food services. What's been interesting, and almost alarming at the same time, is that there are people now coming through the system who have never been in need of food aid or, if you like, poverty services at all. Therefore, they don't know what to do while they are in them. So, for the first time, they are trying to make do with maybe visits to a food bank, maybe visits to a pantry, maybe relying on services like us. But, because it's the first time that they have been involved, they've needed to get involved in services like ours and others. The issue for them, when you're talking to them and you're meeting them for the first time, is that there's a panic\u2014there's a real panic\u2014that they don't know what to do next because they've never been in the situation before. That's coming through now.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, thank you. Jen Griffiths.&nbsp;\n\nJen Griffiths: Thank you. Flintshire is fairly rural. We've got lots of communities that don't have access to the main town centres\u2014we've got five county towns in Flintshire. And what we are noticing, as Robbie's just said, it's people who've never accessed the system. So, we've got support hubs where we offer advice and guidance, but people are coming in who won't access the benefits system because they wouldn't qualify and they don't meet those criteria. However, they're really struggling to pay their bills. It's eat or heat, feed your children or feed yourself, and it's almost like there's a squeezed middle who are missed by the benefits system because they simply wouldn't qualify. However, because of the cost of living, they're just really struggling to cope, and it's certainly something we've seen through our hub models in Flintshire. People we've never bumped into before are accessing services and trying to find ways to alleviate their situation.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Given that there is clearly so much need, how are organisations managing to meet that need? Sarah, you said that you weren't aware of anybody being turned away, but if the public doesn't support your organisations, then the situation could become a whole lot worse, couldn't it?\n\nSarah Germain: Yes, I think they are feeling it\u2014the organisations that are supporting people that are in this situation are starting to feel it themselves. They stepped up to the plate during the pandemic, they've been working really hard all the way through the pandemic to help through that, and then straight off the back of that we're into this cost-of-living crisis. So, I think the organisations are finding it hard. They are feeling that demand. I've got some stats somewhere if I can just find them. They're being hit by the cost-of-living crisis themselves as well, because obviously their bills are going up, the cost of food is going up, wages are starting to go up as well, so the organisations themselves are starting to feel the impact of this as an organisation as well.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Robbie.\n\nRobbie Davison: It's interesting, because the pressure on, if you like, the third sector is continuing to grow and increase, and it's important to note that. What we've been attempting to do as an organisation is\u2014. We have got a completely different model. We've got a commercial model running alongside a social model, and we are trying desperately to move people away from charity alone and to get them to be contributors to their own well-being. And by that I mean we offer four weeks' worth of support that is free to access, which is meals for a week, but after four weeks we start to charge. But we start to charge at a subsidised rate. So, for four weeks, we charge \u00a310 and people get \u00a340 worth of food, and then for the following four weeks\u2014so, it's 12 weeks in total\u2014they pay \u00a315. The reason this is important is because we are using our profits to subsidise the food, but what we are actually asking people to do is to take part in looking after themselves, moving them away from an over-reliance on charity and getting them back into thinking about their own well-being, at a cost that they can afford. Really, really important\u2014good food has to be affordable, otherwise good food will just not be on offer to people.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Sioned Williams wanted to follow up on one of your comments. Sioned.\n\nSioned Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to follow up on a comment made by Sarah from FareShare regarding the increase in demand. In the written evidence, 75 institutions on the waiting list and 42 organisations\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014in specific areas of Wales\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\n\nSarah Germain: Those groups are primarily in south-east Wales, because that's where the majority of our members are.

Sarah, please do continue.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Chair, sorry. Could I just raise a point, which is that I'm having a problem hearing Rob's microphone? I'm not sure if anybody else is having a problem with that microphone.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Well, I think the technicians can raise the volume on that mike.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: There is a red light here and it's just gone\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: No, don't touch\u2014\n\nRobbie Davison: I won't touch it.\n\nSarah Germain: I think that means you're on.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Okay.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Can you hear Robbie now, Jane?&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Can you hear me? Great.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, that's fine. Sarah, back to you.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: Yes. So, those 75 organisations are across south-east Wales, because that's the majority of where we are.

On behalf of Members, I really would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to give evidence today. It's a really important issue; it's something that has the interest of Members of the Senedd, members of the public, and obviously the press and the wider public in Wales. This is something that has come out following the <em>BBC Wales Investigates </em>programme on 23 January. Would you like to make a short opening statement?\n\nIeuan Evans: Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the invitation to appear before the committee this morning. We're very pleased to have the opportunity, and we are aware, as the stewards of Welsh rugby, that we have a great responsibility, and we're aware that we've disappointed the rugby family across Wales. The experience has been sobering for us, but as the new chair, I am determined to make the changes that are necessary to improve rugby in Wales. You will be aware of some of the changes that we have already announced. Also, Nigel has taken the role of acting chief executive.\n\nIeuan Evans: We fully understand and embrace the WRU's unique role in the sporting, economic and civic life in Wales, embedded in its social fabric, and how we project ourselves is critical. We need to get this right; we need to take advice and seek input from others, so we've been working closely with Welsh Government and Sport Wales, and of course, talking to our staff, our players, our member clubs and our commercial partners about the next steps. We are a \u00a3100 million-turnover business, and that includes some public funding. We take our responsibility for spending public funds extremely seriously. We have 80,000 players across 300 clubs, and many more thousands of young people in schools across Wales playing rugby. We're a showcase for Wales to the world. We have a duty, and a responsibility to be as good as we can be, and it's my job to make that happen.Hopefully, today, we can outline for you the changes we have already put in place and answer some of the questions that I'm sure you have. As you know, we will be working with our partners to establish a taskforce with external expertise to help us achieve the cultural change we need, and we'll have more information about that this morning as we finalise some of those details, as they're not all in place as yet. And we've agreed, of course, that Sport Wales will be identifying an independent chair and we will be working with them and the membership in terms of reference for that review, and I'm sure that we can elaborate on that as the hearing goes on. We're happy therefore to provide more details to the committee when those arrangements are finalised.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. So, we'll move on to questions. Why do you think the WRU is in this situation?\n\nIeuan Evans: As a relatively new chair\u2014a matter of weeks\u2014I've been humbled and harrowed by what I've heard, particularly the impact on our female staff and players. I think we all know that we should do more, we need to do more to make the game and our organisation more inclusive, but I was shocked by the personal stories highlighted by our former staff in the programme, and I can only apologise once more to them, and not only them but people elsewhere affected by the allegations in that programme as well, and to say that I will work night and day to ensure that all of our staff feel safe and valued.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. I'll bring Alun Davies in in a moment, but could I just press you on that, because your words are obviously heartfelt, and I appreciate that, but in terms of why you think this has happened, what would be your analysis of that?\n\nNigel Walker: I'm happy to come in there. I think, in any organisation, especially a large organisation like the Welsh Rugby Union, it's possible for things to occur over a period of time and for people to turn a blind eye, and not to address those problems, and then it's not until, sometimes, an organisation is forced to face the reality of the position they find themselves in that they begin to really look deeply and look back to the past and begin to join the dots. So, the warning signs have been there for quite some time. When it's presented as graphically as it was during the BBC Wales programme the week before last, it hits you like a 10-tonne truck.I should offer my apologies. My thoughts are with those members of staff, those players and ex-players who have had an experience that no individual should have. The key now is, yes, we're apologetic, yes, we've made statements, yes, we've accepted that we've got a problem; the key now is to begin to understand the scale and scope of that problem, to seek outside help, which Ieuan has referred to, and to give an undertaking that, when those recommendations come through, whether it's in three months, six months, whenever they come through, we will do everything in our power to implement them, to make sure that the experiences that those women, players, young girls, maybe, have experienced, won't be repeated in the future, or at least you minimise the prospect of those things happening again.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. When you say the very graphic nature of some of these reports that have come out, could you tell us why it took that happening for action to be taken, rather than it happening when these reports had first been made clear to you?\n\nNigel Walker: To be candid, I think, as an organisation, we have been in denial as to the extent of the problem. So, there have been cases in the past that have been dealt with\u2014in theory, dealt with, and people have moved on. I think each individual case is an indication that there has been a wider problem, but people have not joined the dots. When you see it presented over a 30-minute programme in the way that it was, unless you're going to bury your head in the sand for another six months or 12 months, you have to take action, and that's the position we're in. None of us are proud of the position we're in.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. I'm going to bring in Alun.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Thanks very much. Can I challenge you a little bit on your assertion, Mr Evans, that you were shocked by what you've learned? I was reading parts of your autobiography that were scathing about the WRU in different ways. You said that there were people on the WRU who were simply not capable of taking the right decisions because they were too parochial, too insular or just plain short-sighted.&nbsp;You went on to ask how you could have officials from small clubs with no real knowledge of world rugby making decisions that affected the national team, and more often than not affected it for the worse.&nbsp;And you also said, 'At a time when our rivals were planning ahead and learning from the likes of Australia and New Zealand, too many of our people seemed more concerned with ensuring that they had their supply of free tickets and hotel accommodation for international weekend junkets'.Now, that's harsher, in many ways, than anything we've heard in the last week, and that was written some years ago. So, you were clearly aware that there were significant and deep-rooted problems with the WRU, so what you've heard this last week couldn't have shocked you.\n\nIeuan Evans: One of the reasons I came on to the board\u2014and I have been chair for, as I said, a matter of weeks\u2014I've been quite open and candid in my desire to ensure that our organisation is a high-functioning organisation, to drive us to new horizons, and we need to be reflective. My desire\u2014and you've read the press release that went out last night with regard to it\u2014and, as a board, our desire is to convince and compel our member clubs, as we are a union of member clubs and the constitution dictates that clubs need to vote through changes before they can be implemented, that we need to be a diverse, skill set-based board, with an independent chair. I've actively campaigned to find my replacement; we need to have an independent chair. I'm conscious, for us to deliver on our strategic objectives, that we need a board composition overhaul, and it's how we achieve that. We were quite open in the press statement with regard to what we intend to put to the clubs in an extraordinary general meeting at the end of March or earlier. That is our aim, because that's how the organisation needs to be run. Yes, we have a main board, we also have a community game board, which runs the community game with elected representatives from the clubs, and I wish to broaden that and make it a broader church to be truly representative of our game.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I don't disagree with that, but my question was\u2014I think the statement last night was very positive, by the way, I've got no issue about that\u2014my question was about your knowledge about what was happening. You're both giants of our game. You must have had an awareness of what was happening. Your words, Ieuan, were absolutely brutal about the WRU.\n\nNigel Walker: Can I\u2014? Not that Ieuan needs me to defend him, but the words that you've\u2014and I haven't read Ieuan's autobiography, by the way.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Well, you should, it's very illustrative.\n\nNigel Walker: I'm sure that those words were talking in general terms about the running of the organisation. It was the graphic nature of the sexism and misogyny in last week's programme that was the bit that was particularly distressing, talking from my point of view, and I know that Ieuan shares that point of view.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: There was a review in 2021 into the women's game, could you tell us how the WRU responded to that and would you commit to making those findings public?\n\nNigel Walker: I went through and interview process in May/June 2021. At the latter stages of that process, certain elements of that review were presented to me and it became one of the interview questions: 'What would you do?' I was appointed in July and started in September. When I read the review, I was shocked as to the extent of the problem. There are 40 recommendations in the review, and it was obvious that the Welsh Rugby Union had failed women's rugby. You'll find, during the course of the next 40 minutes, I'm just going to be completely honest with you\u2014\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: We appreciate your honesty.\n\nNigel Walker: So, one of my first tasks was to try to address the problems that were present in the women's game. I remember, even before I took up my appointment formally at the end of September, I addressed the women's squad. They were at the NCE, the national centre of excellence, in Hensol, they were all sitting in front of me, and I apologised. Steve Phillips, the CEO, was next to me. I apologised for what they had been through in the recent past and I said that I was here to make changes and that I would be actively pursuing the prospect of a world class programme for our women players. I said that I would have professional contracts in their hands by the end of December. When I said that, at least half a dozen of them looked up at the ceiling\u2014and I've related this story to them\u2014because they'd heard it all before. But, by December 2021, they had professional contracts. We have made enormous progress against the 40 recommendations. I think the recommendations of that review have been circulated. I'm happy to answer any questions, I can talk about the progress that we've made, and I can talk about the areas that are still to be corrected. But, probably 32 or 33 of those recommendations have been implemented in full\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. And the report, it will be published.\n\n"}

To introduce a new sustainable land management objective", "D. To strengthen the fourth sustainable land management objective"], "answer": "C", "content": "Darren Millar AM: So, we'll got straight to item 2 on our agenda, the Agriculture (Wales) Bill Stage 2 consideration. We're undertaking Stage 2 proceedings today for the Agriculture (Wales) Bill. We have the Minister with us today, Lesley Griffiths, and her officials. Would you like to just introduce your officials for the record?\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly. Thank you, Chair. So, over on my left, I have Emma Davies, who is the agricultural Bill manager and Dorian Brunt, who is the senior lawyer for the rural affairs team. And on my right, Hannah Fernandez, head of policy instructions for the Bill, and Mark Alexander, deputy director for land management reform.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you for that, Minister, and welcome to you all.So, the marshalled list of amendments is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled, marshalled into the order that has been agreed by the committee on 16 February. The groupings list shows how amendments have been grouped in order to facilitate the debates today, and the order in which the amendments are called and moved for a vote is dictated by the marshalled list.&nbsp;So, I want to\u2014. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair, I will move the amendments in the name of the Minister, and for expediency, I will assume that the Minister wants to move all of the amendments that have been tabled in her name at the appropriate time, in accordance with the marshalled list. Minister, if you don't&nbsp;want me to do that, then please indicate at the relevant point in the proceedings.So, in line with our usual practice, we've got legal advisers to the committee who are present today and that means that we can suspend proceedings should Members wish to take advantage of that at any time\u2014that legal advice. And in addition, Minister, you can also receive advice, of course, from your officials, hopefully by passing a note, of if you wish to do so, we can suspend proceedings as well, should you need us to do that.\n\nDarren Millar AM: So, we'll start with group 1 of the 16 groups that we have to discuss today: the sustainable land management objectives and the first group of amendments that we're going to be discussing. The lead amendment in this group is amendment 57. I therefore call on Luke Fletcher to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group. I call on Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd, and I move the amendments. And right off the bat, I'd just like to thank the clerks and legal team for their patience with myself as a new Member in going through this process.I'll speak to amendments 57, 1A, 3 and 4. On amendment 57, this amendment seeks to include a requirement relating to protecting food security in SLM objectives. Food security is a critical issue. It directly impacts the health and well-being of people, the environment and economy. Wales has a high level of poverty and food insecurity, particularly among low-income households, which can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Sustainable land management can help to address this issue by promoting the production of nutritious, affordable and locally grown food.&nbsp;Although clause 1 within the Bill includes the production of food as part of the first SLM objective, what we are seeking to do is to provide a clear target for meeting this objective, which must be around ensuring the food security of citizens and access to food to promote good health and well-being.On amendment 1A, which is an amendment, actually, to amendment 1, we're seeking to change 'farmer' to 'active farmer' to ensure that we are clear as to who receives support.On amendment 3, economic resilience is just as important to Welsh farmers as environmental resilience because it is essential for their long-term sustainability and ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions. By investing in both economic and environmental resilience, farmers can build a sustainable and profitable farming operation that can withstand the challenges of the future.And finally, Chair, on amendment 4,&nbsp;'The fifth objective is to seek to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities, recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and agricultural production to the rural economy, and in doing so\u2014'(a) to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and'(b) to contribute to achieving the well-being goals in section 4 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.'\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Luke. I call on Sam Kurtz.\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd like to echo Luke Fletcher's thanks and praise to the legal team and the clerking team for their hand-holding through this process. I am most grateful for that. Speaking to amendment 1, it has been tabled in order to remove any ambiguity in relation to the sustainable land management objective 4. By precisely linking the fourth objective to the role of the farmer, we seek to recognise their integral role in supporting and delivering the objectives of the sustainable land management objective 4. This sits in line with recommendation 10 of the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee report into the Agriculture (Wales) Bill, which seeks to provide explicit policy intent for the support of strong and vibrant rural communities, as was sought by key industry stakeholders.&nbsp;Touching on amendment 1A, I would like to welcome this from Luke Fletcher, and therefore will be supporting it. In relation to amendment 43, the inclusion of the phrase 'landscape' has been made in order to remove any ambiguity about the land we seek to conserve, enhance and promote, as outlined within the fourth objective of this legislation, making it more explicit than 'countryside' alone\u2014indeed, looking at every form of land, be that mountains, uplands, moorlands, seascapes, semi-urban areas, et cetera. So, through recognising this, we also seek to acknowledge that each category possesses its own unique, distinctive character and, with that, separate necessities that require tailored support and assistance.Speaking to amendment 2, the use of the phrase 'existing' has been chosen to, once again, remove any ambiguity as to what farmers should be seeking to promote\u2014in this instance, public access within land designated for agricultural purposes. I'm sure that the Minister will be familiar with the reservations that some have made with regard to public access, especially should that be land that is home to farm animals. What this amendment seeks to do is secure existing public access and provide landowners with a key objective through which they can seek to enhance existing access. By permitting this, we can seek to alleviate significant barriers to increasing the public's connection with and understanding of the natural environment.&nbsp;Speaking to amendment 3, this has been tabled to strengthen the fourth objective in order to recognise the significance of rural economic viability through the means of protecting farm businesses. By protecting, enhancing and promoting the countryside and landscape, cultural resources and public access, we encompass the wider role of the rural economy, sustaining its viability. This amendment seeks to formally recognise that arrangement and enshrine it on the statute book, in line with the aspiration set out within recommendation 10 of the committee report.&nbsp;And finally, Chair, amendment 4 has been tabled with the purpose of introducing a fifth sustainable land management objective, one that seeks to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities through recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and the practice of agricultural production to the rural economy. Land management decisions to achieve the biodiversity, climate and sustainable food objectives cannot be divorced from the economic and social needs or influences that farming families and food supply chain businesses experience. Therefore, we are highly unlikely to achieve our aims at the scale and pace required unless we protect and enhance the economic viability of families and communities delivering the outcomes within the sustainable land management objectives. Thank you, Chair.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. Are there any other members of the committee who wish to speak? If there aren't, then I call on the Minister.&nbsp;\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd just like to begin by thanking Members for their remarks, for their amendments to the Bill and for this opportunity to set out the Government's position regarding them all. I just want to assure Members that both I and my officials have really considered the amendments in detail. Obviously, I'll respond to each amendment in turn and then also introduce amendment 29, which is tabled in my name.Amendment 57: the first amendment in this group alters the first objective so that contributing to the sustainable production of food and other goods is'to protect or improve the food security of citizens and access to food that promotes good health and wellbeing.\u2019Welsh agriculture has a key role to play as the producer of high-quality food, helping to feed our nation and other nations. Food security and access to food that promotes good health and well-being is, however, much, much wider than that, relating to supply-chain considerations, wages, transport, the availability of shops, benefits, healthcare, housing, et cetera. And of course, most of these lie outside the scope of this agricultural Bill, which is why this amendment cannot be accepted.Amendment 1 and amendment 1A, which is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective: the purpose of amendment 1 and amendment 1A appears to seek to limit the fourth SLM objective to farmers, or active farmers only. The concepts of 'farmer' or 'active farmer' do not appear in the Bill, and none of the SLM objectives refer to these terms. So, it's not the policy intention to limit the fourth SLM objective in this way. Introducing this concept now could have unknown consequences for other parts of the Bill. So, for example, a reference in one place of the Bill to a 'farmer' or an 'active farmer' may imply that other parts of the Bill do not apply to the farmer or active farmer. And this is a possible consequence that I'm sure all Members would wish to avoid.&nbsp;Amendment 43: this is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective to refer specifically to landscapes in the countryside, and I don't think this amendment is necessary, as non-urban landscapes are considered to be captured within the term 'countryside', which is already referenced in the fourth objective.&nbsp;Amendment 2 to the fourth SLM objective would limit scope of public access under that provision to what is existing only. Public access is not static, it changes through the actions of farmers and landowners, and others updating access rights. So, restricting action to existing public access is therefore contrary to the policy intention to promote public access to the countryside and our cultural resources.&nbsp;Amendment 3: as I've just mentioned, none of the SLM objectives refer to farmer or any other beneficiary or actor. So, it's therefore not appropriate to include a reference to protecting their economic viability.Amendment 4: this amendment introduces a new SLM objective that is not required. Having resilient agriculture businesses that contribute to our thriving rural communities and help sustain current and future generations of farmers is important. And the intention of this amendment appears to seek to ensure that the Government, potentially, underwrites rural livelihoods, which is outside of the scope of the Bill, and not appropriate. It would also exclude non-rural communities, where agriculture and ancillary activities may take place. And the proposed Government amendment 29 recognises the importance of agricultural businesses in the communities in which they operate.Amendment 29, I'm very pleased to bring this forward, it is the result of productive discussions with Plaid Cymru, as part of the co-operation agreement. The amendment makes provision about factors relevant to determining whether food and other goods are produced in a sustainable manner for the purposes of the first SLM objective. The amendment is intended to highlight the link between the production of food and other goods in a sustainable way, and the resilience of agricultural businesses within the communities in which they operate. Resilient agricultural businesses are vitally important to Wales, contributing to our thriving rural communities, and sustaining Welsh agricultural land for our future generations. Businesses that are resilient and adaptive are more likely to thrive and survive shocks to the sector, such as those we've seen caused by pandemics, conflicts, supply chain issues and climate change. So, I therefore ask that Members agree my amendment 29, and do not agree amendments 57 and 1A in the name of Luke Fletcher, and amendments 1, 43, 2, 3 and 4 in the name of Sam Kurtz. Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Minister. I call on Luke Fletcher to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd. It's naturally disappointing that the Government won't be supporting our amendments. On amendment 57, I think it's important to note that, with the other sustainable land management objectives having much more of an environmental and social focus, it is vital that the sustainable land management objective has clarity around the food production and food security goals. Chair, I propose that we move to a vote.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. So, the question is that amendment 57 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] There is an objection, so we'll proceed to a vote. Those in favour, please raise your hands. And those against. So, I can see that there's a tied vote, so I use my casting vote in the negative, that is, against the amendment, in accordance with Standing Order 6.20(ii). Therefore, amendment 57 is not agreed.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Luke Fletcher, before we dispose of amendment 1, we need to dispose of the amendment to that amendment, which has been tabled in your name\u2014amendment 1A. Do you move that amendment?\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: I move.\n\n"}

", "options": ["A. A debate in the Senedd on a specific petition.", "B. A panel session with Autonomy and 4 Day Week Global.", "C. An open invitation to a public forum.", "D. A meeting with the Business Committee."], "answer": "B", "content": "Jack Sargeant AM: Item 2 on today's agenda is new petitions. For items 2.1 and 2.3, as Chair of the committee, I'm going to use my discretion to bring both of these items together, as they relate to the same topic. Item 2.1 is P-06-1318, 'Exempt A and B roads in Wales from the proposed blanket 20mph speed limit', and item 2.3 is P-06-1322, 'Reallocate the \u00a330m being used for 20mph limits, to the NHS which is in crisis, especially BCUHB!' Item 2.1 was submitted by John Martin Williams and item 2.3 was submitted by Darren Jones.&nbsp;Given the fact this has been debated a number of times in the Senedd, both on the floor of the Senedd and under other matters, as a Petitions Committee we perhaps can't further this work, and this now is a matter again for the floor of the Senedd through individual Members of the Senedd who represent those petitioners. On that basis, I'm going to thank the petitioners for using the process and suggest we close these two petitions this afternoon. Are Members content? I can see all Members are content to close those petitions as suggested.&nbsp;Item 2.2 on today's agendai is P06-1319, 'Provide a pedestrian crossing on A4042 at Goytre Arms crossroads and reduce the speed limit to 20mph':'Make it safe for residents of Penperlleni to cross the A4042 at the Goytre Arms crossroads by providing a pedestrian crossing and extending the existing 20mph speed limit in the village to include this section of the A4042.'This was submitted by Janet Butler, with a total of 656 signatures. At this point, I'll bring committee members in to discuss any actions they may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Could I suggest that we keep this petition open for the time being? There seems to be work under way, and whilst usually these sorts of petitions would be more a matter for the local authority, this is to do with the trunk road network. I notice as well the petitioner has submitted a number of questions; could I also suggest that we forward them on to the Minister as well?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thanks. Diolch yn fawr, Luke, for those suggestions. Are there any comments from Members, or are Members in agreement with Luke Fletcher's suggestion? They are. Okay. We will take that forward and move on.&nbsp;The next petition is item 2.4, P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales':'We call on the Senedd to undertake an inquiry into the prepayment meter scandal. Over the last two months evidence has emerged that thousands of people have been switched to prepay meters without the required checks as to whether they are vulnerable. We at Climate Cymru and other campaigners have been exposing this scandal.'There is additional information available on this petition for members of the committee and members of the public, available online. This was submitted by a former Member of Senedd herself, Bethan Sayed, with a total of 294 signatures. I will bring Buffy Williams in on this petition to discuss any actions we may wish to take.&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I'd also like to thank the petitioner. I can see that the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee has done a large amount of work around this issue and that there are already plans in place to upgrade the sewage system in Brecon, Llanfoist and Usk. I'm not really sure what more we as a committee can do on this petition, so I suggest we close this petition and thank the petitioner again.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: You're ahead one item of business there.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Am I? I'm really sorry, Chair.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: That's okay, Buffy. We're discussing item 2.4, P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales'.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I'm sorry, I am ahead.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: No problem, Buffy.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I am very sorry.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Do you have any comments on that petition?\n\nBuffy Williams MS: One second, so I can get all my papers the right way around. Yes, I've got it here. Sorry. I'm on the right petition now. I know you've done an awful lot of work on this petition, Chair, and I'm used now to hearing you stand in the Chamber and really drive this forward. I think it's a really important petition, and I know that you are driving forward an inquiry on these prepayment meters. So, I think if we leave this petition open and see what comes from the inquiry that our committee is looking to hold, and then go from there.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd.&nbsp;I think we should do a short inquiry into this. I think my inbox, like a lot of other Members'&nbsp;inboxes, is starting to get filled now, and especially with the cost-of-living crisis, it's a particular matter that I think a lot of our constituents are keen for us to get to grips with. So, I would support this committee doing a short inquiry into prepayment meters.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Luke. As Chair and someone who's been campaigning quite heavily on this, it would be, I think, inappropriate for me to push for an inquiry on this, given the fact I would welcome one, so I will remove my comments from today's decision. There has been a suggestion from Buffy and Luke Fletcher to undertake an inquiry, a short piece of work, into this scandal. I look to Altaf Hussain and Rhys ab Owen for agreement on that, or disagreement or further comment. I can see thumbs up and nodding, so I take that as Members' agreement to do this. We will, given that agreement, discuss a way forward and what that might look like in Wales. I know the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee in Westminster are conducting a similar inquiry in their sessions tomorrow.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Item 3 on today's agenda is updates to previous petitions, starting with item 3.1, P-06-1312, 'To help improve water quality in the River Usk by upgrading sewage systems in the Usk valley'. This was submitted by Michael George Cowburn, with 1,612 signatures. I will look to Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. I will go to Buffy Williams in the Rhondda.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: And now this is the right petition. I'd like to thank the petitioner for submitting this petition. It's a really important issue. We have issues in my constituency that are the same. I know ETRA have done a large piece of work around this, and there are plans to upgrade the sewage system in Brecon, Llanfoist and Usk. But again, I'm not quite sure what this committee can do, so I'd suggest that we close this petition and thank the petitioner again.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. I'm a member of ETRA,&nbsp;of course, and we have done a substantial amount of work on this particular issue. I would be with Buffy. I think, just in terms of the nature of this petition, it's more for ETRA to do as a specific subject committee. But could I suggest that we, at least, forward the petition to the committee clerks, and then close?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. That's a valid point, I think, from Luke. Are Members in agreement with Buffy and Luke's suggestions? They are. Okay. We will make sure both the Chair and the clerking team are aware of the petition and the work that we've done to date on that petition.Item 3.2, P-06-1253, 'Ban greyhound racing in Wales'. This was submitted by Hope Rescue with 35,101 signatures in total, with 18,707 of those coming from Wales. This, obviously, was a piece of work we've done an inquiry on, and we debated the committee report in the Senedd on Wednesday last week. Before I move to Members' contributions this afternoon, I should state that there has been a counterpetition, which now has around 6,000 signatures in total and is still collecting signatures at the moment. At the appropriate time that that comes to committee, committee members will consider that petition. But I think it was important to recognise that that petition is currently collecting signatures. At this point, I will move to Members' contributions this afternoon. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just as I begin to make my comments, I'd just like to thank committee members for the work they've been doing on this, but as well to thank both the organisations behind the petition and those who are in favour of racing for giving evidence in the session. I think we struck the chord right in terms of gathering evidence from both sides of the debate. Given that we've had a promise for a consultation from the Minister around greyhound racing, as well as the petition you mentioned earlier, could I suggest that we keep this petition open for the time being, until we have further information on that consultation, or at least a better idea of where the Government is going on this?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch, Luke. Are there any further comments from Members? Buffy Williams.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I'd just like to second everything that Luke has said here. I actually spoke to the League Against Cruel Sports over the weekend. They've also been campaigning on this issue for quite some time, which I actually didn't realise. I think that this is something that we've got to persevere with. Personally, I would just like to continue until we have an outright ban. But that is something personally for me. But I agree with everything that Luke has said.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you for that, Buffy. Are there any comments from Altaf or Rhys? Altaf.&nbsp;\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: I myself would be for a total ban. I would take the point that Luke has made, and I would suggest that we continue with his suggestion.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Altaf, for that. At the stage of debate in the Petitions Committee, we usually consider that the last point of its journey as a petition, but I agree. I think if Members have consensus, given this is a topic that has secured significant debate\u2014not only in the Senedd, but externally as well with the public\u2014and given the fact there is a consultation, which I might encourage those campaigners from both sides of the argument to engage fully with when that is live, and, of course, the counterpetition which has quite quickly, I should say, got to around 6,000 signatures\u2014. I haven't got the figure right in front of me now, but it's around that figure, and still building. I think it is appropriate that we can keep this open and review it, perhaps later on this year, when either the counterpetition comes to committee or the consultation has been launched and closed. I should say I do echo the comments of Luke Fletcher and Buffy as well, and thank those people who helped with the inquiry. It was a useful discussion.Item 3.3, P-06-1323, 'We request that the Welsh Government purchase St David\u2019s Hall as a national resource for Wales'. This was submitted by Ben Herrington, with 3,575 signatures. I'll bring Members in to discuss this position and any actions they may wish to take. Rhys ab Owen.\n\nRhys ab Owen MS: Diolch yn fawr, Gadeirydd. I think we've discussed the Welsh Government's response on at least two occasions\u2014their unsurprising response that they weren't going to purchase St David's Hall, that the funding was not available, and, in any event, there would need to be a substantial five-year plan for them to be able to consider that. I'm not sure whether it would have been the answer for Welsh Government to buy it in any event, but I think that's the only way it could have come before this committee.I think we've postponed making a decision on two previous occasions to await the public consultation from Cardiff Council. I understand that the public consultation had responses from over 1,220 individuals, with the majority\u2014I think, 58 per cent\u2014supporting the council's proposals of having a long-term lease arrangement to manage St David's Hall with Live Nation. Now, obviously, I have major concerns about that, about such an important resource in our capital city being long leased in that way to Live Nation, especially considering the service that St David's Hall has provided to youth music and classical music.Chair, I'm looking to you and the clerking team now, as I'm unsure what more this committee can do, and whether the only option we have at the moment is to thank the petitioner for bringing forward this very important issue to our committee, but our committee's hands are tied at the moment, and that we have no choice but to close this petition. Diolch.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Rhys. Any further comments before I respond? No. Okay. I think you're right, Rhys, that this particular petition has probably reached the end of its journey, but, again, the feeling, obviously, of the public, with this petition itself and a similar petition on change.org, with over 21,000 signatures, clearly shows the strength of feeling. But, given the fact the public consultation from the council has ended that journey, and given the clear steer from the Welsh Government, I think we will have to agree to close this petition and thank the petitioner for using our platform as well. And, of course, I would encourage anyone looking to start a petition in Wales to consider using our platform as well. Any other further comments from Members, or just agreement? Okay.Item 3.4, P-06-1247, 'We call on the Welsh Government to lead the way by supporting trials of a four-day week in Wales'. This was submitted by Mark Hooper, with 1,619 signatures. I will declare an interest at this point; I know other Members will know Mark as well. I know Mark Hooper, the petitioner, myself. We did undertake an inquiry into this particular petition. There were differing views on the committee; I know the Conservative Member, Joel James, who's not here today, had a strong feeling of opposition towards this particular petition. But we did submit our report to the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government have responded to our recommendations. The Deputy Minister for Social Partnership has sent her response back, and in a letter to the committee she has stressed the importance of social partnership and the workforce partnership council, and it is where the Welsh Government will take the proposal to the workforce partnership council at its meeting on 29 March, to consider setting up a working group on a four-day week. And I think it was referenced in that letter by the Deputy Minister that no further decision from the Welsh Government will be taken until that workforce partnership council has either agreed to set up a working group, and, if so, conducted its work there.Given that fact, and given the fact there were differing opinions, not only in this committee, but I remember being one of the early listeners at six o'clock to a BBC Radio Wales phone-in session that had different opinions on this particular petition and the work we've done, can I suggest that perhaps we seek to debate our report in Senedd time and that we'll write to the Business Committee to suggest that? Are Members content with that? They are. Luke Fletcher wanted to come in.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just on the same level as you, I know Mark, so just to declare my interest on that side.But I do think that this is something we should now take to the floor of the Senedd and debate. I completely agree with your proposal, and I just want to take the opportunity to do a shameless plug as well. Next Tuesday, so 21 March, we'll be holding a panel session with Autonomy and 4 Day Week Global in the Senedd, so just an open invitation to those who might be interested who are watching to come along and engage with the panel.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Luke, for that. I'll certainly take an avid interest in that panel discussion, and I'm sure others will as well. Any comments from other Members? No. Okay. On that note, we'll seek to write to Business Committee and of course consider the petition again once we've had a response from them.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Item 4 on today's agenda: we now do conclude our public business of today. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42(ix), that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting, where we will discuss our future work programme, based on two inquiries that this committee is interested in? Are Members content? I can see that they are. Okay, thank you for that. Before I close, just to say that we will meet again on 27 March, and we will now go into private to discuss those items. Diolch yn fawr. Meeting closed.\n"}

This is our first item on Wales-Ireland relations and we're looking forward very much to starting this work. Our first session is with representatives from higher education and business. I'll ask the witnesses to introduce themselves for the record, and I'll go to Oliver first.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: If you could introduce yourself, please, for the record.\n\nOliver Carpenter: Can everyone hear me?\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Yes.\n\nOliver Carpenter: Fantastic. My name's Oliver Carpenter. I'm the policy executive at Chambers Wales. We are focused mainly on helping businesses, all day, every day. That is what we do. And, as a result, this inquiry will be very useful into learning and to give information for you all how Wales and Ireland can work together to further business interests.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Diolch, Oliver. Thank you. I'll ask Amanda to introduce herself, please, for the record.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: Amanda Wilkinson. I'm the director at Universities Wales. Universities Wales is the body representing Welsh universities.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. And I'll ask Berwyn to introduce himself.\n\nBerwyn Davies: Good morning. I'm Berwyn Davies. I'm head of the Welsh Higher Education Brussels office, representing the universities here in Brussels.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you to you all for being with us this morning. We'll move straight to questions, if that's okay, and we'll go first to Heledd Fychan.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you, Chair, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Clearly, there is a strong link and relationship between Wales and Ireland. What I'd like to ask you initially this morning is your view on the importance of these relations with regard to the sectors you represent.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Who would like&nbsp;to go first?\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Anyone who wants to go first, if you want to raise your hand.&nbsp;\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: I'll go to Amanda first.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: So, from a university point of view, relationships with Ireland are very important. We've worked very strategically with colleagues in Ireland through the INTERREG&nbsp;programme. We've also undertaken quite a lot of learning with colleagues in Ireland over the years, and it's fundamentally informed the development of things like our Global Wales programme, our big international programme. So, I think, both in terms of the education international approach and research links, it's been a very important relationship for us.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Does anyone else want to go? Berwyn. Can we unmute Berwyn, please? Great.\n\nBerwyn Davies: So, just to add to that, INTERREG&nbsp;has definitely been an important funding source, but so have the framework programmes in the past. I wouldn't say Ireland is at the top of our list of historical partnerships, but they are very important. We've had, I think, 19 projects with Irish partners in Horizon 2020, the previous programme. We haven't really got the data for Horizon Europe in terms of relations with Ireland. But Ireland is an extremely successful country in terms of Horizon 2020. I think it reached its targets of getting \u20ac1.2 billion out of Horizon 2020. So, it's an important partner for us to partner in that European context as well, in terms of research.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. Before I go back to see whether Oliver wants to contribute, Hefin wants to ask a question.\n\nHefin David AM: Yes. Can I just come back to Amanda? I'm just wondering, from a universities perspective, are there any franchised arrangements, franchised courses in Ireland\u2014any of the kind of international arrangements that we see across the world?\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: Sorry, do you mean franchising within Ireland?\n\nHefin David AM: Yes, franchising within Ireland. Yes, or any other kind.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: I don't know the answer to that, Hefin, but I can check and find out for you.\n\nHefin David AM: Okay. I'm just wondering about the relationships between universities here and higher education in the country and whether there's the development of the kinds of partnership links you'd see with, say, Greece or China, or anything like that.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: I'm not aware of those sorts of relationships with Ireland, Hefin, but I will check, but not as commonly as you would find with other countries and other regions.\n\nHefin David AM: Okay, thanks.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thanks for that.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Oliver, did you want to add anything to this?\n\nOliver Carpenter: Yes. I would say that, from a business perspective, a decent portion of Welsh trade is with Ireland, but there's a great opportunity for there to be more that's done through the Celtic connection and through sectors that would benefit both Ireland and Wales\u2014so, tourism, manufacturing, travel, that kind of thing.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: If I can just pick up from that point, then, what do you think needs to happen to facilitate that? What are the barriers at the moment?\n\nOliver Carpenter: That's a good question. There's the general barrier of the economy at the moment, which isn't very conducive to trade. Obviously, recently, with the Windsor framework that's recently come in with Northern Ireland, that's slightly eased trading tensions between the UK and Northern Ireland, and, as a proxy, that will affect the likelihood of Wales's trade to Northern Ireland and therefore Wales to Ireland as well.&nbsp;I would say that one of the barriers is, therefore, the economy, and I would say partially its infrastructure. We know that soon in Wales we're going to hopefully be getting a free port, potentially, an economic investment zone, and that will help as well. And then, also, it's probably partially political will as well. I think there needs to be more done from those in Welsh Government to push for trade with Ireland.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you. If I can just pick up more generally, then, you've mentioned some of the challenges. Obviously, the B word\u2014Brexit\u2014is something that came through strongly in terms of the evidence received prior to this, and especially with some of the universities, in terms of projects and so on. Can I just ask, therefore, in terms of some of the challenges that you're seeing\u2014I think it was the evidence that suggested some of the challenges between movement of students, collaboration with Erasmus, et cetera\u2014if you could expand on some of the impacts of Brexit and some of the challenges that we need to overcome if we're to continue to develop these relationships? I don't know who might want to go first.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Berwyn or Amanda? Amanda.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: I was going to say that Berwyn can probably answer that a little bit better than I can. In relation to Erasmus, as you know, it's obviously been a significant loss for universities, and I think we've been very pleased that we've been able to set up the Taith programme here in Wales to help support those mobilities. Of course, it can't exactly replicate Erasmus. But, we do have, I think, over and above other UK nations, more levers to support mobility, and that is important to us. And, of course, Irish students are treated as home students, so that's also very helpful.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Berwyn.\n\nBerwyn Davies: So, we haven't got the data for Taith at the moment in terms of higher education into Ireland. We've got, I believe, a global figure, and there's also, of course, the Turing programme that does allow Welsh students to go abroad, and we're looking to get data from that as well. We don't know yet whether there has been any outward mobility to Ireland, but I think, in the evidence that Aberystwyth gave, and also, I think, Bangor as well, I think Bangor accounts for about 21 per cent of Irish students in Wales, and there are key partnerships there in terms of degree mobility as well. So, the question really is to maintain and to build on those collaborations and exchanges.&nbsp;\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: If I may, therefore, as you referred to the evidence from Aberystwyth University, well, Professor Treasure was quite honest with us in terms of her discontent, perhaps, that very little progress had been made in terms of ensuring that relations continued as a result of Brexit, and one of the issues was that European Union funding for the projects that she listed was expected to come to an end and that there isn't a great deal of hope for a continuation of those projects at the moment. Does that reflect the sector's view more widely, that there is genuine concern that some projects aren't going to be able to continue? I want to understand who you think should be looking at these issues and what the role of the Welsh Government is in that regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Berwyn.\n\nBerwyn Davies: The Government has been active and doing as much as they can, for example, in creating this new fund, Agile Cymru, which tries to keep some of those relationships going. It doesn't take INTERREG's place at all in terms of the investment that can be put into it. So, there will be a big question about that funding in the future. I think one of the most important things, of course, is whether we'll be able to join Horizon Europe. It would give us a great boost to be able to continue with these partnerships\u2014for example, in looking at whether some of the projects that have been funded through INTERREG are then able to apply to Horizon Europe, if we are able to join that programme as a full member.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you. Amanda, do you have anything to add?\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: This is part of a wider problem that we have in relation to the structural funds, but it's true for the INTERREG projects as well, that we haven't seen a replacement of funds that we might be expecting and that universities are largely cut out of eligibility for a lot of replacement funds. So, I think this is an issue, and I think it's something we need to think about very carefully here in Wales\u2014what are the key projects that are really going to matter to us, going forward, and which of these might we wish to bridge into potential Horizon Europe projects? Because, even if we're successful in associating with the next Horizon programme, then I still think we're going to have a period where we have to get some of these projects to work and be successful. So, there's still an issue, I think, around how we bridge some of them, if we wish to keep some of these joint projects with Ireland going.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Who's leading those conversations at the moment? Obviously, concerns have been raised, and you're saying you're hoping, et cetera, but who's driving that at the moment? Do you think there's enough clarity, or are concerns being listened to? I'm just trying to understand how we can ensure that some of the unanswered questions following Brexit are addressed, so that there's clarity for the sector.\n\nAmanda Wilkinson: So, we've done quite a bit of work focusing on Westminster in the last three months. I do think what happens with the next round of prosperity funding does matter if we're going to keep some of these projects going. And if we can't keep them going, then we need to think fairly strategically about which of these projects are going to be the most important to us. Because, at the moment, there's not an obvious place for universities to go.\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: Thank you. If I may, Oliver, I saw you agreeing in terms of the funding there and clarity. Perhaps you'd want to expand in terms of your sector.\n\n"}

Can I thank you both for being with us today and just ask you to introduce yourselves for the public record?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. My name is Sue Tranka, I am the Chief Nursing Officer for Wales, working at the Welsh Government. I'm also the nurse director for NHS Wales.\n\nGill Knight: Good morning, committee and Chair. My name is Gillian Knight. I'm a nursing officer working in the Welsh Government, working with the chief nursing officer.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482725\">FootnoteLink</a>\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Members will have various questions this morning, but if I can kick off with the first: is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good question, 'Is the nursing workforce in crisis?' I think you have to look across the globe to understand whether Wales's nursing workforce is in crisis. We are not unique within Wales. The World Health Organization has set out very clearly that the vacancies are over 50 per cent for the nursing and midwifery workforce across the globe, and that's of all the healthcare workers.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482718\">FootnoteLink</a> Within Wales, we have\u2014and you will have seen\u2014the RCN's report, 'Nursing in Numbers' from last year, and we are very grateful to the RCN for the work that they have done. But you will have seen a growing number of vacancies within the workforce.We have pieces of work that are ongoing to address the current vacancies. I think, if we are to continue along the path that the workforce is on, then we are certainly not going to be able to recoup what is becoming increasingly difficult challenges. I think there is a lot of work for us to do around the right recruitment, training the right numbers of staff, retaining the ones we have\u2014because we have incredible staff who are doing an exceptional job under very challenging, very difficult circumstances\u2014and then, we have to continue to attract the right people into the profession.\n\nRussell George AM: So, is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: I think it's really challenged. I think it's really very difficult currently. We have a growing number of vacancies, and I think there is work to be done. I'm not sure I would necessarily label it as 'crisis', but I think I would certainly say it is perhaps the most challenged position I have seen in my 31 years as a nurse.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you, Sue, for that. You've listed some of the challenges already, but in terms of setting the context for the rest of the session, perhaps just bullet-point what you think the challenges are, not just for the workforce within the community, but also in public health roles as well. So, what would you bullet-point are the specific challenges?\n\nSue Tranka: I don't think you can carve off challenges for community or challenges for public health nurses or challenges for the acute sector nurses. I think the entirety of the workforce is experiencing the same set of challenges, just in different levels of severity, I suspect. The challenges I think first and foremost are retention. I think we have a workforce who are making decisions about where else they would like to work, making decisions about the working conditions they are currently under, and making decisions to choose not to stay in nursing. So, retention is clearly one of the biggest issues we have within the nursing workforce.Second to that is that the Minister has invested a huge amount of money. I will ask Gill to confirm, but I think it's \u00a3260 million in 2023-24 in terms of training numbers and commissions and the training in education plan.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482719\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We have the highest number of nurses within Wales that we have had. Since 2016 I think it's 55 per cent that the commissions have grown. So, in terms of the recruitment of numbers, and the training numbers coming through, that's not necessarily the biggest problem, but you will be aware that we don't necessarily recruit to a 100 per cent of the training numbers we require and we need in Wales. So, I think recruitment in Wales is an issue. I think recruitment in Wales, in certain specialties as well, continues to be an issue.I think the health and well-being of our workforce is one that cannot be underestimated. Since the pandemic, since 2020, our workforce have been experiencing significant mental health, physical health and general health conditions. I think that is post-traumatic stress, moral injury and distress, and current circumstances will only lead you to have a look and see that nurses have made decisions about their own health in the workplace.&nbsp;So, I think, retention, recruitment, attraction are those big factors within the workforce. And working conditions cannot be underestimated. The working conditions have to be right to enable our workforce to stay, to have joy in their work, to want to continue to give of their very best in this very difficult landscape. So, I think those have to be considered as the top issues.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: A lot of what you've mentioned I think Members have got some specific questions on, so they'll pick those up later in the session. Are there any specific challenges in terms of the midwifery workforce that you would like to highlight?\n\nSue Tranka: I think I would start by saying that our midwifery workforce has grown by something like 97 per cent in the last five years, and that is really positive.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482720\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We continue to see our midwives stay with us, and we do retain our midwives. However, we have an emerging challenge in midwifery, which is not dissimilar to what we're seeing in nursing. I think what we are seeing in midwifery is a greater requirement on care. It's a greater demand on services. And I think that is reflected in whether our workforce continue to stay with us, if we can recruit the right numbers of midwives, and that we can care for those midwives in the services where they provide care, particularly over the community and acute sectors.I don't think the issues or the concerns that midwives experience are dissimilar to that which nurses experience. And I would go further to say that I don't think that these are unique to the nursing profession. I would say that healthcare workers across the sector, post-pandemic, in the last three years, have had the most challenged time that cannot be underestimated, from both a physical impact and mental health impact, and a general provision of services. I think it has been exceptional for them.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Yes, I quite understand. Thank you. Jack Sargeant.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, both; yes, it's still morning. The Minister is in negotiations at the moment with a number of trade unions, and I refer the Chair to my interest before as a trade union member. Can I ask what role you play as chief nursing officer in advising the Minister and the Welsh Government on nurses' pay in particular?\n\nSue Tranka: My role as an official does not extend into any pay negotiations; that is a matter for the Minister. The Minister is advised by the policy officials for workforce, the workforce director. My role is to offer any advice on any packages that are being put together, in order to understand, and, I suppose, assess, how that plays through to the nursing workforce. I think that is my entire role in terms of the professional advice that I would bring to the Minister. I do not engage in any of the further discussions on pay outside of the offer.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. I think that clears my question up very well.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Joyce, do you want to come in?\n\nJoyce Watson AM: I would ask if you have an opinion about the recent Welsh Government advice to health boards that lower risk patients could be discharged without a care package.\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you for that. I think, first, I'd like to clear up any misinterpretations of that letter. Contextually, it's really important to set out why that letter was sent. Currently, in our healthcare provision across Wales, we have anything between 1,700 to 2,000 patients who should not be in our acute beds because they do not require emergency, urgent or acute care. I think having patients in acute beds is fundamentally wrong for those patients\u2014they become more unwell, they tend to deteriorate, they decondition significantly and then we go into a cycle of requiring further care. So, these patients should certainly not be there.The letter that we sent out during a very difficult period was not that patients should go home without a package of care\u2014that would be irresponsible, and that goes against my professional values and that of the Welsh Government. What we have asked is that those who do not have a perfect package of care\u2014. And let me give you an example of what that means: a patient waiting to go home for support in the home for something like a two or three-times-a-day package of care. Whilst waiting for that full package to be put in place, the request was whether a conversation could be had with the patient, family members, loved ones, if somebody could support that patient with that extra requirement in the day until that full package could come into effect.I think that is a fair request, at a time when the harm in the community is so high, when patients can\u2019t be seen, when they cannot be conveyed to hospital, when they are having really severe and significant conditions awaiting care\u2014that we ask a question of that nature. And I think that was the responsible thing to do. I think the key here is that we wanted it to be a safe discharge and that is really an important thing to understand. There is a set of assessments and procedures that take place at a health board level prior to a patient being discharged. By no means does a letter leave the Welsh Government and a health board chooses to discharge a patient simply without applying any type of professional judgment.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: How would we monitor? Is there a capacity in place to monitor? Whilst it might be safe medically, there's the social aspect to that and the pressures on the wider workforce that you previously mentioned in trying to deliver that. How do we monitor the need for care, which might not be medical, but nonetheless is there, and the pressure that that might then in turn put on those delivering it without that full care package and ensuring their well-being?\n\nSue Tranka: There is a mechanism currently by which we review that. For example, where community nurses need to step into that space temporarily to support a package of care that is not a full package of care currently, we will record that through what we have in the community system currently, which is a digital system that monitors demand and capacity and scheduling. So, we would look at what is the additional demand that is coming into the community, how they\u2019ve managed to reschedule and move their work around to manage within the community provision, and then understand that gap and then do some work to understand what needs to be done to close that gap. It is quite a new system. It\u2019s been in place only a couple of months. We are waiting for a full read-out of that data, which will probably be in the next six months or so, where we can understand it. Currently, it is there, it is being assessed on a daily basis by those who are using it, but the Welsh Government hasn\u2019t had a full report yet and we won\u2019t have one for a few months yet.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: Thank you.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Just to follow up on Jack Sargeant's question, I suppose, and to understand more about your role\u2014. I ask the question in the context of the current negotiations and views in terms of nurses' pay and conditions. I'm just trying to understand how you balance perhaps potentially two different elements of your role. One is providing recommendations and guidance to the Welsh Government, as you've set out to Jack, and the other is being the voice of the nursing profession and standing up for the nursing profession, who clearly have a different view at the moment in terms of pay and conditions to the Government. So, how do you balance those two positions?\n\n"}

So, welcome to all of you.In light of the fact the Trussell Trust isn't here with us today, I did notice in its evidence that there had been a sort of drop-off in the demand for food, marginally, in the month of July, when there was a cost-of-living payment made by the UK Government, but that it was then back up to really high levels again in August. I just wondered if you could, very briefly, just summarise what the current situation is, given that we have got your written evidence in all cases. Just how difficult is it for organisations that are endeavouring to ensure that everybody is eating and heating?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: I can start, if you like. So, the demand just isn't going away. It's going up, if anything. As an organisation ourselves that supports other organisations, we are finding that we are getting more and more requests for support. In addition, the organisations that we are working with are also asking for more food. So, the organisations that we are already working with are asking for more food, and we are always having more organisations asking us for food as well.FareShare UK did a survey back in September-October time, and it found that 96 per cent of our community food members in south Wales were saying that they had had an increase in demand since January the previous year. So, that shows that almost every organisation that we are working with has seen that increase in demand.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, are people actually being turned away?\n\nSarah Germain: I don't know if people are being turned away. I know that we, and they, are finding it difficult to meet the demand that is there, and that demand is growing constantly.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Who are the main people who are using these services? We know, obviously, that anybody with children, anybody with a disability, and also private renters whose housing benefit isn't covering the cost of their rent, are in a desperate situation. Is that a reasonable summary of who you are seeing?\n\nSarah Germain: I think that it's across the board. There are all sorts of organisations. We work with all sorts of organisations. We work with everyone from homeless hostels, women's refuges, through to pantries and community kitchens. So, we work with a whole host of organisations, and I think that demand is going up across the board. But the highest levels of demand are within groups\u2014. The highest demand groups are families with children, older people and lone parents. Those are the three highest groups that our community groups are saying that that they've seen an increase in demand from.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Robbie Davison or Jen Griffiths.\n\nRobbie Davison: I'd just add that there's a kind of new poverty going on. I don't know if I put in the evidence that we've submitted that we are noticing about a 20 per cent increase in people wanting good food services. What's been interesting, and almost alarming at the same time, is that there are people now coming through the system who have never been in need of food aid or, if you like, poverty services at all. Therefore, they don't know what to do while they are in them. So, for the first time, they are trying to make do with maybe visits to a food bank, maybe visits to a pantry, maybe relying on services like us. But, because it's the first time that they have been involved, they've needed to get involved in services like ours and others. The issue for them, when you're talking to them and you're meeting them for the first time, is that there's a panic\u2014there's a real panic\u2014that they don't know what to do next because they've never been in the situation before. That's coming through now.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, thank you. Jen Griffiths.&nbsp;\n\nJen Griffiths: Thank you. Flintshire is fairly rural. We've got lots of communities that don't have access to the main town centres\u2014we've got five county towns in Flintshire. And what we are noticing, as Robbie's just said, it's people who've never accessed the system. So, we've got support hubs where we offer advice and guidance, but people are coming in who won't access the benefits system because they wouldn't qualify and they don't meet those criteria. However, they're really struggling to pay their bills. It's eat or heat, feed your children or feed yourself, and it's almost like there's a squeezed middle who are missed by the benefits system because they simply wouldn't qualify. However, because of the cost of living, they're just really struggling to cope, and it's certainly something we've seen through our hub models in Flintshire. People we've never bumped into before are accessing services and trying to find ways to alleviate their situation.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Given that there is clearly so much need, how are organisations managing to meet that need? Sarah, you said that you weren't aware of anybody being turned away, but if the public doesn't support your organisations, then the situation could become a whole lot worse, couldn't it?\n\nSarah Germain: Yes, I think they are feeling it\u2014the organisations that are supporting people that are in this situation are starting to feel it themselves. They stepped up to the plate during the pandemic, they've been working really hard all the way through the pandemic to help through that, and then straight off the back of that we're into this cost-of-living crisis. So, I think the organisations are finding it hard. They are feeling that demand. I've got some stats somewhere if I can just find them. They're being hit by the cost-of-living crisis themselves as well, because obviously their bills are going up, the cost of food is going up, wages are starting to go up as well, so the organisations themselves are starting to feel the impact of this as an organisation as well.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Robbie.\n\nRobbie Davison: It's interesting, because the pressure on, if you like, the third sector is continuing to grow and increase, and it's important to note that. What we've been attempting to do as an organisation is\u2014. We have got a completely different model. We've got a commercial model running alongside a social model, and we are trying desperately to move people away from charity alone and to get them to be contributors to their own well-being. And by that I mean we offer four weeks' worth of support that is free to access, which is meals for a week, but after four weeks we start to charge. But we start to charge at a subsidised rate. So, for four weeks, we charge \u00a310 and people get \u00a340 worth of food, and then for the following four weeks\u2014so, it's 12 weeks in total\u2014they pay \u00a315. The reason this is important is because we are using our profits to subsidise the food, but what we are actually asking people to do is to take part in looking after themselves, moving them away from an over-reliance on charity and getting them back into thinking about their own well-being, at a cost that they can afford. Really, really important\u2014good food has to be affordable, otherwise good food will just not be on offer to people.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Sioned Williams wanted to follow up on one of your comments. Sioned.\n\nSioned Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to follow up on a comment made by Sarah from FareShare regarding the increase in demand. In the written evidence, 75 institutions on the waiting list and 42 organisations\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014in specific areas of Wales\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\n\nSarah Germain: Those groups are primarily in south-east Wales, because that's where the majority of our members are. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Sorry.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Sorry, Sarah. We just have to take a halt for a moment because we've lost Sioned. Are you able to hear what Sarah Germain's starting to say?&nbsp;\n\nSioned Williams MS: Yes, I can hear.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Excellent. We lost you momentarily. Sarah, please do continue.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Chair, sorry. Could I just raise a point, which is that I'm having a problem hearing Rob's microphone? I'm not sure if anybody else is having a problem with that microphone.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Well, I think the technicians can raise the volume on that mike.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: There is a red light here and it's just gone\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: No, don't touch\u2014\n\nRobbie Davison: I won't touch it.\n\nSarah Germain: I think that means you're on.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Okay.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Can you hear Robbie now, Jane?&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Can you hear me? Great.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, that's fine. Sarah, back to you.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: Yes. So, those 75 organisations are across south-east Wales, because that's the majority of where we are. There is another waiting list in north Wales of about 10 organisations up there, and they're across the board. Yes, that's where the\u2014. Yes.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Thank you. I saw Jane next, I think, and then Altaf.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Yes, I just wanted to ask what's the main reason that adults approach you. We've heard that pensioners and single parents do access your services, but what are the main reasons? Is it because they're on benefits or because they're not being paid enough in employment to afford food? What's the main reason? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\n"}

This session today will provide us with an opportunity to hear about the chief nursing officer's priorities and nursing and midwifery professions in Wales, and to discuss challenges as well. Can I thank you both for being with us today and just ask you to introduce yourselves for the public record?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. My name is Sue Tranka, I am the Chief Nursing Officer for Wales, working at the Welsh Government. I'm also the nurse director for NHS Wales.\n\nGill Knight: Good morning, committee and Chair. My name is Gillian Knight. I'm a nursing officer working in the Welsh Government, working with the chief nursing officer.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482725\">FootnoteLink</a>\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Members will have various questions this morning, but if I can kick off with the first: is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good question, 'Is the nursing workforce in crisis?' I think you have to look across the globe to understand whether Wales's nursing workforce is in crisis. We are not unique within Wales. The World Health Organization has set out very clearly that the vacancies are over 50 per cent for the nursing and midwifery workforce across the globe, and that's of all the healthcare workers.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482718\">FootnoteLink</a> Within Wales, we have\u2014and you will have seen\u2014the RCN's report, 'Nursing in Numbers' from last year, and we are very grateful to the RCN for the work that they have done. But you will have seen a growing number of vacancies within the workforce.We have pieces of work that are ongoing to address the current vacancies. I think, if we are to continue along the path that the workforce is on, then we are certainly not going to be able to recoup what is becoming increasingly difficult challenges. I think there is a lot of work for us to do around the right recruitment, training the right numbers of staff, retaining the ones we have\u2014because we have incredible staff who are doing an exceptional job under very challenging, very difficult circumstances\u2014and then, we have to continue to attract the right people into the profession.\n\nRussell George AM: So, is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: I think it's really challenged. I think it's really very difficult currently. We have a growing number of vacancies, and I think there is work to be done. I'm not sure I would necessarily label it as 'crisis', but I think I would certainly say it is perhaps the most challenged position I have seen in my 31 years as a nurse.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you, Sue, for that. You've listed some of the challenges already, but in terms of setting the context for the rest of the session, perhaps just bullet-point what you think the challenges are, not just for the workforce within the community, but also in public health roles as well. So, what would you bullet-point are the specific challenges?\n\nSue Tranka: I don't think you can carve off challenges for community or challenges for public health nurses or challenges for the acute sector nurses. I think the entirety of the workforce is experiencing the same set of challenges, just in different levels of severity, I suspect. The challenges I think first and foremost are retention. I think we have a workforce who are making decisions about where else they would like to work, making decisions about the working conditions they are currently under, and making decisions to choose not to stay in nursing. So, retention is clearly one of the biggest issues we have within the nursing workforce.Second to that is that the Minister has invested a huge amount of money. I will ask Gill to confirm, but I think it's \u00a3260 million in 2023-24 in terms of training numbers and commissions and the training in education plan.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482719\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We have the highest number of nurses within Wales that we have had. Since 2016 I think it's 55 per cent that the commissions have grown. So, in terms of the recruitment of numbers, and the training numbers coming through, that's not necessarily the biggest problem, but you will be aware that we don't necessarily recruit to a 100 per cent of the training numbers we require and we need in Wales. So, I think recruitment in Wales is an issue. I think recruitment in Wales, in certain specialties as well, continues to be an issue.I think the health and well-being of our workforce is one that cannot be underestimated. Since the pandemic, since 2020, our workforce have been experiencing significant mental health, physical health and general health conditions. I think that is post-traumatic stress, moral injury and distress, and current circumstances will only lead you to have a look and see that nurses have made decisions about their own health in the workplace.&nbsp;So, I think, retention, recruitment, attraction are those big factors within the workforce. And working conditions cannot be underestimated. The working conditions have to be right to enable our workforce to stay, to have joy in their work, to want to continue to give of their very best in this very difficult landscape. So, I think those have to be considered as the top issues.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: A lot of what you've mentioned I think Members have got some specific questions on, so they'll pick those up later in the session. Are there any specific challenges in terms of the midwifery workforce that you would like to highlight?\n\nSue Tranka: I think I would start by saying that our midwifery workforce has grown by something like 97 per cent in the last five years, and that is really positive.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482720\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We continue to see our midwives stay with us, and we do retain our midwives. However, we have an emerging challenge in midwifery, which is not dissimilar to what we're seeing in nursing. I think what we are seeing in midwifery is a greater requirement on care. It's a greater demand on services. And I think that is reflected in whether our workforce continue to stay with us, if we can recruit the right numbers of midwives, and that we can care for those midwives in the services where they provide care, particularly over the community and acute sectors.I don't think the issues or the concerns that midwives experience are dissimilar to that which nurses experience. And I would go further to say that I don't think that these are unique to the nursing profession. I would say that healthcare workers across the sector, post-pandemic, in the last three years, have had the most challenged time that cannot be underestimated, from both a physical impact and mental health impact, and a general provision of services. I think it has been exceptional for them.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Yes, I quite understand. Thank you. Jack Sargeant.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, both; yes, it's still morning. The Minister is in negotiations at the moment with a number of trade unions, and I refer the Chair to my interest before as a trade union member. Can I ask what role you play as chief nursing officer in advising the Minister and the Welsh Government on nurses' pay in particular?\n\nSue Tranka: My role as an official does not extend into any pay negotiations; that is a matter for the Minister. The Minister is advised by the policy officials for workforce, the workforce director. My role is to offer any advice on any packages that are being put together, in order to understand, and, I suppose, assess, how that plays through to the nursing workforce. I think that is my entire role in terms of the professional advice that I would bring to the Minister. I do not engage in any of the further discussions on pay outside of the offer.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. I think that clears my question up very well.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Joyce, do you want to come in?\n\nJoyce Watson AM: I would ask if you have an opinion about the recent Welsh Government advice to health boards that lower risk patients could be discharged without a care package.\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you for that. I think, first, I'd like to clear up any misinterpretations of that letter. Contextually, it's really important to set out why that letter was sent. Currently, in our healthcare provision across Wales, we have anything between 1,700 to 2,000 patients who should not be in our acute beds because they do not require emergency, urgent or acute care. I think having patients in acute beds is fundamentally wrong for those patients\u2014they become more unwell, they tend to deteriorate, they decondition significantly and then we go into a cycle of requiring further care. So, these patients should certainly not be there.The letter that we sent out during a very difficult period was not that patients should go home without a package of care\u2014that would be irresponsible, and that goes against my professional values and that of the Welsh Government. What we have asked is that those who do not have a perfect package of care\u2014. And let me give you an example of what that means: a patient waiting to go home for support in the home for something like a two or three-times-a-day package of care. Whilst waiting for that full package to be put in place, the request was whether a conversation could be had with the patient, family members, loved ones, if somebody could support that patient with that extra requirement in the day until that full package could come into effect.I think that is a fair request, at a time when the harm in the community is so high, when patients can\u2019t be seen, when they cannot be conveyed to hospital, when they are having really severe and significant conditions awaiting care\u2014that we ask a question of that nature. And I think that was the responsible thing to do. I think the key here is that we wanted it to be a safe discharge and that is really an important thing to understand. There is a set of assessments and procedures that take place at a health board level prior to a patient being discharged. By no means does a letter leave the Welsh Government and a health board chooses to discharge a patient simply without applying any type of professional judgment.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: How would we monitor? Is there a capacity in place to monitor? Whilst it might be safe medically, there's the social aspect to that and the pressures on the wider workforce that you previously mentioned in trying to deliver that. How do we monitor the need for care, which might not be medical, but nonetheless is there, and the pressure that that might then in turn put on those delivering it without that full care package and ensuring their well-being?\n\nSue Tranka: There is a mechanism currently by which we review that. For example, where community nurses need to step into that space temporarily to support a package of care that is not a full package of care currently, we will record that through what we have in the community system currently, which is a digital system that monitors demand and capacity and scheduling. So, we would look at what is the additional demand that is coming into the community, how they\u2019ve managed to reschedule and move their work around to manage within the community provision, and then understand that gap and then do some work to understand what needs to be done to close that gap. It is quite a new system. It\u2019s been in place only a couple of months. We are waiting for a full read-out of that data, which will probably be in the next six months or so, where we can understand it. Currently, it is there, it is being assessed on a daily basis by those who are using it, but the Welsh Government hasn\u2019t had a full report yet and we won\u2019t have one for a few months yet.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: Thank you.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Just to follow up on Jack Sargeant's question, I suppose, and to understand more about your role\u2014. I ask the question in the context of the current negotiations and views in terms of nurses' pay and conditions. I'm just trying to understand how you balance perhaps potentially two different elements of your role. One is providing recommendations and guidance to the Welsh Government, as you've set out to Jack, and the other is being the voice of the nursing profession and standing up for the nursing profession, who clearly have a different view at the moment in terms of pay and conditions to the Government. So, how do you balance those two positions?\n\n"}

Welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Finance and Local Government. The first question today is from Hefin David.\n\nHefin David AM: 1. What assessment has the Welsh Government made of the potential impact of increasing the basic rate of income tax in Wales? OQ59146\n\nRebecca Evans AM: Raising the basic rate would add additional costs on those less able to afford it at a time when the UK Government has frozen income tax thresholds, dragging lower earners into the income tax system.\n\nHefin David AM: I think the key point made by the Minister there is that, at the time, I think income tax is something that should be revisited in the future, but she's absolutely right to say that this is not the time for it. Last week, we saw an amendment to the Welsh Government's budget by Plaid Cymru that would have cost people on the basic rate \u00a32.47 a week extra, during a cost-of-living crisis. Personally, my view is that the co-operation agreement should not have allowed that amendment to be put, given that it covers the budget, and it was disappointing to see that that happened outside the co-operation agreement. We should see Plaid Cymru taking responsibility for the power they have in the Senedd Chamber. Would the Minister be willing, though, to review this position in the future, should economic circumstances allow at some point?\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I'm very grateful to Hefin David for the question, and for raising Welsh rates of income tax this afternoon. And I completely agree with his assessment that it is not the right time, in a cost-of-living crisis, to be asking those who are on the absolute lowest incomes, and indeed those who have been drawn into the income tax system for the very first time, to be paying more. And I think it's well established that, to raise any serious amount of money in order to boost the resources that we have, we would be required to raise the basic rate of income tax. I do think that it has to be done in a considered and strategic way. That said, every single year, we do assess our options, in terms of how we use the Welsh rates of income tax, and we would expect to look afresh again at this issue next year, both in terms of people's overall tax burden and contribution, depending on where things are with the UK Government, and, of course, the wider economic situation that people find themselves in. But, absolutely, it's something that we consider afresh for every budget.\n\nTom Giffard MS: As we heard from Hefin David there, one of the perils of increasing income tax at a time of financial trouble is the fact that it would be something built on the back of working people across Wales. And it's quite apt, I think, on the day that Nicola Sturgeon resigned as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland, to remember exactly where Plaid Cymru got this idea from, because they devolve a lot of their thinking out to a party from another part of the United Kingdom\u2014the SNP. Because, in Scotland, they're proposing to add 1p onto the higher and top rates of tax, alongside reducing the top rate threshold, from \u00a3150,000 to just over \u00a3125,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that that will spark an exodus of high earners across the border. Scottish business leaders have branded it a disadvantage for Scotland and made clear that it would make competing with the UK for talent much harder. On top of those increases, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has not ruled out a 10 per cent hike in council taxes there. In a survey, half of all Scots wanted the current system of council tax to end. Another survey showed that one in five Scottish households are currently living in serious financial difficulty, equivalent to 1.2 million people; in the UK overall, it's 17 per cent. That's Plaid's vision for Wales, Minister, and it's a vision that's built on the back of taxing working people. Do you agree with me that that's a totally wrong priority, at the wrong time, from a party that is increasingly out of touch with the people of Wales?\n\nRebecca Evans AM: Well, I would gently remind the Member that, under the UK Conservative Government, the tax burden on people in Wales, and across the UK, is now at a 70-year high as a result of the decisions that that Government has made. But I do think that Scottish rates of income tax are very much a matter for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament, but that doesn't mean that we can't learn from their experiences, which is why we're very interested in the work that HMRC is progressing in terms of developing a longitudinal data set. Now, that hopefully will allow us to have some more detailed analysis of the behavioural impacts of tax changes, including migration responses, and my officials are in frequent contact with HMRC to better understand the possibilities that that work might release.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: 2. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Climate Change and the Minister for Social Justice regarding Welsh Government support to ease the financial pressures on scheduled bus services? OQ59129\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I regularly engage with my Cabinet colleagues on funding issues. In this financial year, we have made available over \u00a3110 million of funding to protect and grow bus services right across Wales. The bus emergency scheme has also been extended into the next financial year.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's undoubtedly the case, Minister, that cross-Government working, finding the money to put in place the emergency bus support and also extending it now for the next few months has been critical to ensuring the survival of the bus industry in Wales, including independent operators, small family operators and so on that run their businesses. But we know the pressures that your budget is under, but we also do know that this is genuinely a climate justice issue, and it's also a social justice issue, as we keep being told, quite rightly. And we can repeat this endlessly until it gets into people's minds that 80 per cent of those people who use buses have no other alternative. So, can I simply urge\u2014this is not asking for magic money\u2014but can I genuinely urge her, in her discussions with the Minister for Climate Change, and the Minister for Social Justice and Cabinet colleagues, to do all she possibly can to try and find that way that we can keep these bus services going in all our communities\u2014rural and urban Wales. It's vital, going forward, particularly after the announcement yesterday about turning a corner a different way to deal with shifting people to more sustainable travel.&nbsp;\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I'm grateful for the question and completely agree with the points that are made about bus services being a critical part of our approach to delivering social justice here in Wales, and, of course, an important part of our environmental aspirations as well. I think that our support for the bus industry through the pandemic and now at the other side of the pandemic has been absolutely crucial in terms of maintaining the services that we do have in Wales. But it was a bus emergency scheme, and I think that this level of subsidy is just not sustainable in the long term, which is really why we are looking at reviewing the bus services support grant, to move the industry away from that kind of reliance on the emergency funding to something that is much more stable in the future. And colleagues will be aware of our ambitious plans, in terms of the bus Bill that we aim to bring forward, to bring more control back to local authorities in terms of the services that are provided. So, I think that, really, is the longer term answer, but, in the meantime, our support is really important for the industry.&nbsp;\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: Minister, I have raised on a number of occasions the plight of residents across my region who have suffered as the result of cuts to scheduled bus services.&nbsp;The most recent issue brought to my attention is a proposal by First Cymru to cut services to Resolven in my region.&nbsp;Many people in Resolven, particularly the elderly, are dependent upon the X7 service, as their nearest post office or bank is over seven miles away. Any reduction in service will have a bad impact on a community like Resolven.&nbsp;I have also been contacted by Neath Port Talbot Council, who are concerned that the Welsh Government\u2019s decision to axe bus emergency scheme 3 funding is leading to the acceleration in cuts to these bus services. If BES3 funding goes, companies operating services within Port Talbot and Neath will deregister most routes within the county borough. Minister, will you reconsider the decision to end BES3 funding and look at other ways to support a struggling bus industry that is so vital to many of our constituents?\n\n"}

Increased pay for public servants", "B. Recruitment crisis", "C. Decreased workload for staff", "D. Improved retention rates"], "answer": "B", "content": "John Griffiths AM: We will move on to item 2 on our agenda today, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our first evidence session with the Welsh Local Government Association. So, let me welcome our witnesses, then: Councillor Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council and leader of the Welsh Local Government Association; Anthony Hunt, leader of Torfaen County Borough Council; Councillor Llinos Medi, leader of Anglesey county council; Christina Harrhy, chief executive of Caerphilly County Borough Council; and Chris Llewelyn, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association. So, croeso, welcome to you all.Perhaps I might begin, then, with some general questions by way of an overview, and firstly, then, for the Welsh Local Government Association to provide a brief overview of the current financial situation facing local authorities in Wales. Andrew, I guess that's you.\n\nAndrew Morgan: Thank you, Chair. If I can just start, and perhaps I'll hand over to my colleagues. I think it's fair to say that the pressure this financial year and going into the next financial year is on a scale that, certainly in my time of being a councillor, which is since 2004, we've not faced. In terms of double-digit inflation, it's bad enough, but there obviously is the pressure on the pay award, which is agreed across England and Wales, which is considerable this year, but not least as well in terms of energy costs and supply chain costs. If you consider food costs for things like school meals, our care home services and meals on wheels, food costs have gone up anything between 14 and 25 per cent. Our gas and energy costs are predicted for this financial year for local authorities in Wales to go up around 355 per cent for gas, and well over 100 per cent for electric. So, there are some real pressures on local authorities. I know every year we talk about the pressures on local government, whether it's service demand such as social services in particular, but this year I think it is quite exceptional.Local government is facing a significant overspend this year\u2014in excess of \u00a3200 million is the figure that we have collated between the 22 authorities. I think it's fair to say that since devolution, local government has never overspent \u00a3200 million in a single financial year. My own authority is set to overspend by around \u00a320 million this year, so we'll be using reserves, and most local authorities are looking to use reserves. And next year, even though we are having a very good settlement from&nbsp;the Welsh Government, and we are grateful for the additional funding that's been passported on, there is going to be significant pressure on local authorities to set a balanced budget. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Andrew. Any other of our witnesses? Anthony.&nbsp;\n\nAnthony Hunt: Thank you, Chair. The pressures are substantial. We estimate \u00a3784 million cumulatively to the end of the next financial year. Just in social care, for example, it's \u00a395.2 million of pressures, \u00a332 million from children's residential placements, adult residential placements \u00a312 million, adult domiciliary care \u00a37.5 million. Just to use my own authority as an example, our energy costs are estimated to rise by \u00a34 million, our social care costs by \u00a34 million, and our pay bill by just over \u00a37 million. Those are real pressures that can't just be managed away easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Would any other of our witnesses like to add anything to what Andrew or Anthony have said? Llinos.&nbsp;\n\nLlinos Medi: I think in addition to the cost pressures and inflation is the service demand as well that we're seeing a massive increase in, due to the cost-of-living crisis. So, it's a perfect storm of the demand on services and the cost of delivering the services at the same time.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Diolch yn fawr. In terms of the experience during the pandemic, where, obviously, local authorities again were under tremendous pressure, how would you compare the current situation with the situation at that time? Who would like to offer a view on that? Christina.&nbsp;\n\nChristina Harrhy: I think that the big difference here is that throughout COVID the Welsh Government helpfully provided us with some short-term funding. And as Llinos has already mentioned, as we're coming out of COVID, there's increased demand, but it's not only increased demand, it's increased complexity of demand. And then when you couple that with the depleted workforce\u2014. Because one of the things that has happened post COVID is that, for a number of reasons, a lot of public servants have decided to leave public service. Coupled with the reduced funding that we are facing, the increased demand and complexity, and a depleted workforce and difficulty in recruiting and retention, I think it's essentially a perfect storm. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Christina. Llinos.&nbsp;\n\nLlinos Medi: I will be speaking in Welsh; I didn't use the interpretation earlier. It's also important that we note that during COVID, normal services had a period where they weren't necessarily being provided, so we were focused on the COVID crisis. Now, we have a cost-of-living crisis on top of all the other crises hitting society, as well as the financial crisis that we as an authority are facing. But planning expectations continue, and public protection and all the other requirements placed upon us as an authority remain, and we can't cope with all of these crises as well as business as usual and public expectation on local authorities. And much of that, of course, is statutory, for example planning and so on. So, the pressure now is more intense because of that.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Diolch yn fawr, Llinos. Andrew, did you want to come in as well?\n\nAndrew Morgan: Yes, just to add to and support what Christina Harrhy said. Obviously, during the pandemic, we did receive extraordinary amounts of funding, both to support communities and to support services, and certainly end-of-year funding as well, which has obviously helped our balances, carrying forward to this year, which has now helped us in terms of overspends. But the difficulty is of course that that was an exceptional amount of funding, and one-off funding, to deal with the short-term problem. In effect, the pandemic was a short-term hit for things like income, which has largely recovered in lots of areas, though there are some legacy issues there. But going forward now, general revenue, in terms of our revenue budget, is under massive pressure from four key drivers\u2014the inflation, the energy costs, the service demand, and pay pressures. All of them are almost like a perfect storm for public services across the board, and local authorities are no different.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much for that. Obviously, the potential impact on services is something that all of us will be very concerned about. Is there anything in particular you would like to say in terms of that potential impact? Is there anything that you'd like to highlight? Andrew.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew Morgan: Every local authority will have to address this, obviously, as part of their budget-setting round and the various consultations they're doing. But even though we've had a relatively good settlement, it has to be said\u2014the average figure is much more positive than was anticipated, with consequentials being passed on\u2014there is a range from the low end, such as authorities like myself and Merthyr, to, I think, Monmouthshire, which is at the higher end this year, and Cardiff. So, there is obviously fluctuation in the formula, but the formula is there because it is driven by demand, such as population, school numbers, and various other drivers, which impact on that.But turning back to individual councils setting their budgets, there's no getting away from the fact that there will be some tough decisions. There is a balance to be struck between council tax increases at a significant rate, making savings where possible without impacting on services, but, undoubtedly, there will be other cuts to services, or service changes that, I think I'm fair in saying, all 22 local authorities will have to consider to a certain extent. That may be changing things like bin services, it could be cutting or closing some sports facilities; there is a whole raft of things that local authorities are considering, but it is obviously down to those individual authorities to make those tough decisions.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Okay. Llinos.\n\nLlinos Medi: I know that you're already aware of this, so I don't want to be\u2014. But this is us making cuts to services that have previously been cut, so the options are very few and far between. And when we've been able to maintain some semblance of service in some areas, it may mean that may have to disappear, and clearly that's a real cause of concern. So it's important to note that we weren't in an ideal starting point. I sometimes fear that we forget about the decades of cuts that we've undertaken already.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Anthony.\n\nAnthony Hunt: I just wanted to come back to the point that Christina made about workforce\u2014that's a very important one, looking to the medium term. This isn't just a cash issue, this is an issue with more and more people deciding to walk away from public services. They've seen their pay depleted by 20 per cent over the past decade, they're expected to continually do more with less, with fewer staff, and I really feel that we're staring in the face of a recruitment crisis within some key public services. We're seeing it in social care, in domiciliary care, and we're seeing it actually in more areas than I've ever seen before, where we're really struggling to recruit to key posts. And after all, public services are the sum total of the people who work in them, so I think that's an issue that we have to look into as well.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thanks for that. We will come on to these matters in a little more detail later on. Before I bring in other committee members, could I just ask one further question? I think it was Llinos who mentioned that demand is obviously significant, and so have others of you. We hear reports that Welsh Government, in response to the pressures that hospitals face, and emergency services face, will be encouraging discharges from hospital perhaps without care packages being fully in place at that stage. Is there anything that you'd like to say about that in terms of the potential pressure on local authority services? Andrew.\n\n"}

What steps has the Welsh Government taken to create a coherent and integrated Welsh benefits system?", "C. How does the Welsh Government plan to simplify the application process for benefits?", "D. What is the Bevan Foundation's position on Welsh benefits?"], "answer": "B", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the Minister for Social Justice, and the first question is from Russell George.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: 1. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Health and Social Services about ensuring equal access to public toilets for disabled people? OQ59514\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you for your question. I have set up the disability rights taskforce to advance disability rights in Wales. I engaged with all ministerial colleagues to determine the action that needs to be taken in each portfolio area, including access to public toilets for disabled people.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you for your answer, Minister. According to the Great British Public Toilet Map, there are 25 public toilets in Montgomeryshire, in my constituency, but only seven of those are available to those with disabilities. This is really concerning, particularly as there are a lot of people across the county who do have disabilities and need to use a public toilet more than most for various reasons, and they need to have confidence that when they go to a public toilet that there are going to be appropriate facilities for them, not to mention, of course, that Montgomeryshire is a tourism hotspot, at least it is at the moment. And I hope, Minister, you also recognise how important it is in attracting holidaymakers who will also have disabilities. I'm thinking particularly of a project in my constituency. Berriew Community Council, just off the trunk road, are very keen to bring forward facilities for those with disabilities also. But, I wonder what advice you can give in terms of what the Welsh Government can support, because so far they're having real difficulty in attracting the appropriate funds in order to update the facilities.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Russell George. A really important question. We know that a lack of accessible local toilets can limit disabled people's lives, stopping them going out, leading to isolation, anxiety, health conditions, and those are the factors that we need to address. In fact, the Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination not only in the workplace, but in wider society, and we need to promote and deliver on our ambitions to give equal rights and dignity to disabled people in Wales. Now, we have got public toilets provision, and the provision of changing places is moving forward, because\u2014they're not in my portfolio\u2014changes have been made to the building regulations regarding the provision of changing places specifically focused for disabled people. These changes came into force on 3 January.I think your community council would be well advised to engage with the local authority\u2014Powys County Council in this respect\u2014because we also have, under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017, a requirement for each local authority in Wales to produce a local toilet strategy for its area, in consultation with residents and other delivery partners, which would be your community council. It's important, actually, that that Act's provisions are designed to improve toilet provision for everyone and to recognise that, as part of their local toilet strategies, local authorities are required to assess the needs of their communities, including those of disabled people and their carers, and to take steps through the strategy to meet those needs.\n\nJane Dodds MS: 2. Will the Minister provide an update on the learning to date from the care leavers basic income pilot? OQ59510\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much for your question. A comprehensive and detailed resarch strategy is in place to evaluate the basic income pilot, led by Cardiff University, but it is too early to provide data on the impact of the programme. We anticipate being able to publish further monitoring data on the basic income pilot in the autumn.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Thank you so much, Minister. It's pleasing to hear the promising early feedback surrounding the basic income pilot for care leavers, especially comments from you noting that we're already beginning to see the benefits of the scheme. I remember, as well, the motion that I tabled last year, back in July, which called on the Welsh Government to consider how a basic income pilot could be extended to include workers employed in heavy industry\u2014the transition basic income pilot. We've got a legal challenge with Aberpergwm mine ongoing and the announcement this year that Liberty Steel would be letting go of 150 workers from its Newport and Torfaen sites. Therefore, there is a dire need to provide workers with stability and security as these industries change. And the Government is expected to look at their just transition framework for a net-zero Wales in the future. We need to take communities with us and to provide the support that they need. So, could I ask you what conversations you've had, perhaps, across with Ministers for climate change and economy as part of creating a just transition framework on expanding the basic income pilot, following its current iteration, to support workers to transition to green jobs? Diolch.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch, Jane Dodds. And I'd like to thank you for your consistent support for the basic income pilot for our care leavers, with the support you've given since the day we announced it here in the Senedd. I just want to say that the Deputy Minister for Social Services, Julie Morgan, and I met with care leavers at the end of October to discuss the pilot and their experience of it, and learning from them is going to feed into the evaluation. I'm pleased that, of the young people who were eligible in the first six months of the pilot, 92 per cent signed up and were already receiving their monthly payment. And it is important that we link this to your debate and the questions that you've also asked, about updates on this work.In terms of the just transition, you'll be aware, of course, that the Minister for Climate Change took a call for evidence on just transition between last year and 15 March. There has been a good response to that and they're being analysed, so that will come through. And I think what's important to recognise is that the policy drive for our basic income pilot is to support care leavers to make that positive transition from local authority care, using basic income as a means. And, as I've said before, basic income is the mechanism for this, rather than the purpose of the programme, to give care leavers a real chance and opportunity in life. So, I know that we will be able to look at not just the evaluation of the basic income pilot in terms of that use of that mechanism and the impact it has on care leavers, but also how you could look at it in terms, clearly, of the just transition and opportunities there, when we hear from that call for evidence.\n\nJoel James MS: As you will know, Minister, research has continually shown that those who have gone through foster, residential or kinship care are more likely to become parents at a far younger age than others. Indeed, studies in the UK have shown that almost a quarter of young care leavers have children at the point of leaving care, and this proportion increases to almost 50 per cent around two years later, with evidence showing the reasons behind this being the conscious and unconscious seeking of unmet relational and familial needs. I'm extremely supportive that more needs to be done to help those who have gone through the care system, but I still question whether or not a UBI trial is the right way, especially as it has a cliff-edge end to it when the monthly income of \u00a31,600 comes to an end after two years. With this in mind, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the impact that this trial will have on young care-experienced parents and their children when their extra income ends, because I'm genuinely concerned about the negative ramifications that can happen when people who have adjusted their spending patterns and lifestyle to accommodate extra income suddenly find themselves without it? Thank you.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much, Joel James, for that question. I know you will anticipate and, I'm sure, be very interested in the interim results from this Cascade\u2014the Cardiff University Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre\u2014independent evaluation. And this is about seeking to understand the impact of the pilot on the lives of care leavers, and, as you know, it runs until 2026, very much engaging with the views and experiences of young people involved in the pilot. And, of course, we have much engagement support around those young people\u2014local authority stakeholders, Voices from Care Cymru, Citizens Advice partners\u2014helping and supporting our young people in terms of overcoming challenges. But also, just from our experience of meeting with the young people, the scope of their ambition, their interest, their determination for their lives to progress as a result of this opportunity they've been given sets them in very good stead for their future\u2014their whole adult life, I'd say. This is about actually seeing if their whole adult life ahead of them could be transformed by this trust and funding and financial support that we're giving to these young people. Yes, of course, already some of those care-experienced young people who are on the pilot will be in this situation\u2014there will be young parents\u2014and they will move on, as all young people do, into adult life. But I think that's a very useful observation in terms of looking at their experience.Can I just say that 50 per cent of young people enrolled have responded to the Your Life Beyond Care survey? That's a really important survey. Obviously, the Deputy Minister for Social Services is responsible for care leavers and care-experienced young people, and I'm delighted that the First Minister launched, with a number of Ministers, the declaration that came from care-experienced young people. And I do urge the Member, and all Members, to look at that declaration, because that declaration came from work that they did themselves\u2014young people\u2014to tell us in Government how they felt we could do better, at local authority and at Welsh Government level, in supporting care leavers at every stage of their young lives.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: It will be no surprise to hear that Plaid Cymru is in favour of the care leavers basic income pilot, and there's pleasure that the pilot is ongoing. That has been replaced by disgust at some of the ways that Tory Members across the floor from me have twisted this policy. To those who are peddling dog-whistle politics reminiscent of Trump, I say this, 'You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.'Minister, I'd like to see the timescale set out by the Government, so that when the results of this trial come back\u2014and I anticipate that they will be positive\u2014there are clear markers rolled out, so that extensive basic income can continue. We cannot afford to let a scheme that could be as transformational as this to drift into the ether.&nbsp;\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Peredur, and such an important question. I'm reluctant to go back\u2014but I will do\u2014to say how shocked we were by this attack on our basic income pilot, which came from ill-informed, inaccurate and misleading information that came from the Conservatives. We are clear about that. It wanted to undermine what we were doing, but, most of all, undermine those young people who are most vulnerable in our nation of sanctuary\u2014our unaccompanied asylum seeker children, who have always been included as eligible. And can I put that on the record again for the basic income pilot? As category 3 care leavers\u2014. I have to say to everyone here, you have all got young people, care leavers, in this pilot. Every single local authority in this Chamber has got care leavers in this pilot. Remember that. And they are, I'm sure, wanting to ensure that we are backing them as they go through this important pilot and, of course, as I've said, the comprehensive detailed research and publishing further monitoring data later on this year.But also, just to say, as to those young people we are supporting, we will want, as you have described very clearly, to support them through every entitlement that they have\u2014every entitlement that they have. And that includes a right to claim asylum in the UK.&nbsp;So, I hope we can move on from that, but also, just to say, as far as our care leavers and care-experienced young people are concerned, they are listening and watching what we are saying in this Chamber, backing them in their prospects\u2014and there are prospects\u2014for their life chances and life opportunities.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Mark Isherwood.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Diolch, Llywydd. Your ministerial responsibilities, as you know, include co-ordination of cross-cutting measures to promote prosperity and tackle poverty. Speaking here last October in the debate on a Member's legislative proposal for a take-up of benefits Bill, I challenged the Welsh Government on the actions it had taken to establish a coherent and integrated Welsh benefits system for all the means-tested benefits it is responsible for, as recommended in the 2019 committee report on benefits in Wales. Last month's Bevan Foundation report on a common approach to Welsh benefits stated that they have long called for a single framework of grants and allowances termed a 'Welsh benefits system', that this system would remove the complex and confusing application process and has the potential to lift people out of poverty. Their findings demonstrate that establishing a Welsh benefits system is feasible in terms of data, that millions of pounds of unclaimed benefits could support those on low incomes, and that the regulations governing Welsh benefits are set by a Welsh Government and so it's within their power to introduce regulatory amendment to facilitate greater uniformity.&nbsp;How do you therefore respond to these findings, and what action are you now taking further to the debate last year and to the report last month? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\n"}

My name is Gillian Knight. I'm a nursing officer working in the Welsh Government, working with the chief nursing officer.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482725\">FootnoteLink</a>\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Members will have various questions this morning, but if I can kick off with the first: is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you, Chair. Good question, 'Is the nursing workforce in crisis?' I think you have to look across the globe to understand whether Wales's nursing workforce is in crisis. We are not unique within Wales. The World Health Organization has set out very clearly that the vacancies are over 50 per cent for the nursing and midwifery workforce across the globe, and that's of all the healthcare workers.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482718\">FootnoteLink</a> Within Wales, we have\u2014and you will have seen\u2014the RCN's report, 'Nursing in Numbers' from last year, and we are very grateful to the RCN for the work that they have done. But you will have seen a growing number of vacancies within the workforce.We have pieces of work that are ongoing to address the current vacancies. I think, if we are to continue along the path that the workforce is on, then we are certainly not going to be able to recoup what is becoming increasingly difficult challenges. I think there is a lot of work for us to do around the right recruitment, training the right numbers of staff, retaining the ones we have\u2014because we have incredible staff who are doing an exceptional job under very challenging, very difficult circumstances\u2014and then, we have to continue to attract the right people into the profession.\n\nRussell George AM: So, is the nursing workforce in crisis?\n\nSue Tranka: I think it's really challenged. I think it's really very difficult currently. We have a growing number of vacancies, and I think there is work to be done. I'm not sure I would necessarily label it as 'crisis', but I think I would certainly say it is perhaps the most challenged position I have seen in my 31 years as a nurse.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you, Sue, for that. You've listed some of the challenges already, but in terms of setting the context for the rest of the session, perhaps just bullet-point what you think the challenges are, not just for the workforce within the community, but also in public health roles as well. So, what would you bullet-point are the specific challenges?\n\nSue Tranka: I don't think you can carve off challenges for community or challenges for public health nurses or challenges for the acute sector nurses. I think the entirety of the workforce is experiencing the same set of challenges, just in different levels of severity, I suspect. The challenges I think first and foremost are retention. I think we have a workforce who are making decisions about where else they would like to work, making decisions about the working conditions they are currently under, and making decisions to choose not to stay in nursing. So, retention is clearly one of the biggest issues we have within the nursing workforce.Second to that is that the Minister has invested a huge amount of money. I will ask Gill to confirm, but I think it's \u00a3260 million in 2023-24 in terms of training numbers and commissions and the training in education plan.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482719\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We have the highest number of nurses within Wales that we have had. Since 2016 I think it's 55 per cent that the commissions have grown. So, in terms of the recruitment of numbers, and the training numbers coming through, that's not necessarily the biggest problem, but you will be aware that we don't necessarily recruit to a 100 per cent of the training numbers we require and we need in Wales. So, I think recruitment in Wales is an issue. I think recruitment in Wales, in certain specialties as well, continues to be an issue.I think the health and well-being of our workforce is one that cannot be underestimated. Since the pandemic, since 2020, our workforce have been experiencing significant mental health, physical health and general health conditions. I think that is post-traumatic stress, moral injury and distress, and current circumstances will only lead you to have a look and see that nurses have made decisions about their own health in the workplace.&nbsp;So, I think, retention, recruitment, attraction are those big factors within the workforce. And working conditions cannot be underestimated. The working conditions have to be right to enable our workforce to stay, to have joy in their work, to want to continue to give of their very best in this very difficult landscape. So, I think those have to be considered as the top issues.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: A lot of what you've mentioned I think Members have got some specific questions on, so they'll pick those up later in the session. Are there any specific challenges in terms of the midwifery workforce that you would like to highlight?\n\nSue Tranka: I think I would start by saying that our midwifery workforce has grown by something like 97 per cent in the last five years, and that is really positive.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C482720\">FootnoteLink</a>&nbsp;We continue to see our midwives stay with us, and we do retain our midwives. However, we have an emerging challenge in midwifery, which is not dissimilar to what we're seeing in nursing. I think what we are seeing in midwifery is a greater requirement on care. It's a greater demand on services. And I think that is reflected in whether our workforce continue to stay with us, if we can recruit the right numbers of midwives, and that we can care for those midwives in the services where they provide care, particularly over the community and acute sectors.I don't think the issues or the concerns that midwives experience are dissimilar to that which nurses experience. And I would go further to say that I don't think that these are unique to the nursing profession. I would say that healthcare workers across the sector, post-pandemic, in the last three years, have had the most challenged time that cannot be underestimated, from both a physical impact and mental health impact, and a general provision of services. I think it has been exceptional for them.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Yes, I quite understand. Thank you. Jack Sargeant.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, both; yes, it's still morning. The Minister is in negotiations at the moment with a number of trade unions, and I refer the Chair to my interest before as a trade union member. Can I ask what role you play as chief nursing officer in advising the Minister and the Welsh Government on nurses' pay in particular?\n\nSue Tranka: My role as an official does not extend into any pay negotiations; that is a matter for the Minister. The Minister is advised by the policy officials for workforce, the workforce director. My role is to offer any advice on any packages that are being put together, in order to understand, and, I suppose, assess, how that plays through to the nursing workforce. I think that is my entire role in terms of the professional advice that I would bring to the Minister. I do not engage in any of the further discussions on pay outside of the offer.&nbsp;\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. I think that clears my question up very well.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: Joyce, do you want to come in?\n\nJoyce Watson AM: I would ask if you have an opinion about the recent Welsh Government advice to health boards that lower risk patients could be discharged without a care package.\n\nSue Tranka: Thank you for that. I think, first, I'd like to clear up any misinterpretations of that letter. Contextually, it's really important to set out why that letter was sent. Currently, in our healthcare provision across Wales, we have anything between 1,700 to 2,000 patients who should not be in our acute beds because they do not require emergency, urgent or acute care. I think having patients in acute beds is fundamentally wrong for those patients\u2014they become more unwell, they tend to deteriorate, they decondition significantly and then we go into a cycle of requiring further care. So, these patients should certainly not be there.The letter that we sent out during a very difficult period was not that patients should go home without a package of care\u2014that would be irresponsible, and that goes against my professional values and that of the Welsh Government. What we have asked is that those who do not have a perfect package of care\u2014. And let me give you an example of what that means: a patient waiting to go home for support in the home for something like a two or three-times-a-day package of care. Whilst waiting for that full package to be put in place, the request was whether a conversation could be had with the patient, family members, loved ones, if somebody could support that patient with that extra requirement in the day until that full package could come into effect.I think that is a fair request, at a time when the harm in the community is so high, when patients can\u2019t be seen, when they cannot be conveyed to hospital, when they are having really severe and significant conditions awaiting care\u2014that we ask a question of that nature. And I think that was the responsible thing to do. I think the key here is that we wanted it to be a safe discharge and that is really an important thing to understand. There is a set of assessments and procedures that take place at a health board level prior to a patient being discharged. By no means does a letter leave the Welsh Government and a health board chooses to discharge a patient simply without applying any type of professional judgment.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: How would we monitor? Is there a capacity in place to monitor? Whilst it might be safe medically, there's the social aspect to that and the pressures on the wider workforce that you previously mentioned in trying to deliver that. How do we monitor the need for care, which might not be medical, but nonetheless is there, and the pressure that that might then in turn put on those delivering it without that full care package and ensuring their well-being?\n\nSue Tranka: There is a mechanism currently by which we review that. For example, where community nurses need to step into that space temporarily to support a package of care that is not a full package of care currently, we will record that through what we have in the community system currently, which is a digital system that monitors demand and capacity and scheduling. So, we would look at what is the additional demand that is coming into the community, how they\u2019ve managed to reschedule and move their work around to manage within the community provision, and then understand that gap and then do some work to understand what needs to be done to close that gap. It is quite a new system. It\u2019s been in place only a couple of months. We are waiting for a full read-out of that data, which will probably be in the next six months or so, where we can understand it. Currently, it is there, it is being assessed on a daily basis by those who are using it, but the Welsh Government hasn\u2019t had a full report yet and we won\u2019t have one for a few months yet.\n\nJoyce Watson AM: Thank you.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. Just to follow up on Jack Sargeant's question, I suppose, and to understand more about your role\u2014. I ask the question in the context of the current negotiations and views in terms of nurses' pay and conditions. I'm just trying to understand how you balance perhaps potentially two different elements of your role. One is providing recommendations and guidance to the Welsh Government, as you've set out to Jack, and the other is being the voice of the nursing profession and standing up for the nursing profession, who clearly have a different view at the moment in terms of pay and conditions to the Government. So, how do you balance those two positions?\n\n"}

The eligibility of category 3 care leavers"], "answer": "B", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the Minister for Social Justice, and the first question is from Russell George.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: 1. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Health and Social Services about ensuring equal access to public toilets for disabled people? OQ59514\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you for your question. I have set up the disability rights taskforce to advance disability rights in Wales. I engaged with all ministerial colleagues to determine the action that needs to be taken in each portfolio area, including access to public toilets for disabled people.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you for your answer, Minister. According to the Great British Public Toilet Map, there are 25 public toilets in Montgomeryshire, in my constituency, but only seven of those are available to those with disabilities. This is really concerning, particularly as there are a lot of people across the county who do have disabilities and need to use a public toilet more than most for various reasons, and they need to have confidence that when they go to a public toilet that there are going to be appropriate facilities for them, not to mention, of course, that Montgomeryshire is a tourism hotspot, at least it is at the moment. And I hope, Minister, you also recognise how important it is in attracting holidaymakers who will also have disabilities. I'm thinking particularly of a project in my constituency. Berriew Community Council, just off the trunk road, are very keen to bring forward facilities for those with disabilities also. But, I wonder what advice you can give in terms of what the Welsh Government can support, because so far they're having real difficulty in attracting the appropriate funds in order to update the facilities.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Russell George. A really important question. We know that a lack of accessible local toilets can limit disabled people's lives, stopping them going out, leading to isolation, anxiety, health conditions, and those are the factors that we need to address. In fact, the Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination not only in the workplace, but in wider society, and we need to promote and deliver on our ambitions to give equal rights and dignity to disabled people in Wales. Now, we have got public toilets provision, and the provision of changing places is moving forward, because\u2014they're not in my portfolio\u2014changes have been made to the building regulations regarding the provision of changing places specifically focused for disabled people. These changes came into force on 3 January.I think your community council would be well advised to engage with the local authority\u2014Powys County Council in this respect\u2014because we also have, under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017, a requirement for each local authority in Wales to produce a local toilet strategy for its area, in consultation with residents and other delivery partners, which would be your community council. It's important, actually, that that Act's provisions are designed to improve toilet provision for everyone and to recognise that, as part of their local toilet strategies, local authorities are required to assess the needs of their communities, including those of disabled people and their carers, and to take steps through the strategy to meet those needs.\n\nJane Dodds MS: 2. Will the Minister provide an update on the learning to date from the care leavers basic income pilot? OQ59510\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much for your question. A comprehensive and detailed resarch strategy is in place to evaluate the basic income pilot, led by Cardiff University, but it is too early to provide data on the impact of the programme. We anticipate being able to publish further monitoring data on the basic income pilot in the autumn.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Thank you so much, Minister. It's pleasing to hear the promising early feedback surrounding the basic income pilot for care leavers, especially comments from you noting that we're already beginning to see the benefits of the scheme. I remember, as well, the motion that I tabled last year, back in July, which called on the Welsh Government to consider how a basic income pilot could be extended to include workers employed in heavy industry\u2014the transition basic income pilot. We've got a legal challenge with Aberpergwm mine ongoing and the announcement this year that Liberty Steel would be letting go of 150 workers from its Newport and Torfaen sites. Therefore, there is a dire need to provide workers with stability and security as these industries change. And the Government is expected to look at their just transition framework for a net-zero Wales in the future. We need to take communities with us and to provide the support that they need. So, could I ask you what conversations you've had, perhaps, across with Ministers for climate change and economy as part of creating a just transition framework on expanding the basic income pilot, following its current iteration, to support workers to transition to green jobs? Diolch.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch, Jane Dodds. And I'd like to thank you for your consistent support for the basic income pilot for our care leavers, with the support you've given since the day we announced it here in the Senedd. I just want to say that the Deputy Minister for Social Services, Julie Morgan, and I met with care leavers at the end of October to discuss the pilot and their experience of it, and learning from them is going to feed into the evaluation. I'm pleased that, of the young people who were eligible in the first six months of the pilot, 92 per cent signed up and were already receiving their monthly payment. And it is important that we link this to your debate and the questions that you've also asked, about updates on this work.In terms of the just transition, you'll be aware, of course, that the Minister for Climate Change took a call for evidence on just transition between last year and 15 March. There has been a good response to that and they're being analysed, so that will come through. And I think what's important to recognise is that the policy drive for our basic income pilot is to support care leavers to make that positive transition from local authority care, using basic income as a means. And, as I've said before, basic income is the mechanism for this, rather than the purpose of the programme, to give care leavers a real chance and opportunity in life. So, I know that we will be able to look at not just the evaluation of the basic income pilot in terms of that use of that mechanism and the impact it has on care leavers, but also how you could look at it in terms, clearly, of the just transition and opportunities there, when we hear from that call for evidence.\n\nJoel James MS: As you will know, Minister, research has continually shown that those who have gone through foster, residential or kinship care are more likely to become parents at a far younger age than others. Indeed, studies in the UK have shown that almost a quarter of young care leavers have children at the point of leaving care, and this proportion increases to almost 50 per cent around two years later, with evidence showing the reasons behind this being the conscious and unconscious seeking of unmet relational and familial needs. I'm extremely supportive that more needs to be done to help those who have gone through the care system, but I still question whether or not a UBI trial is the right way, especially as it has a cliff-edge end to it when the monthly income of \u00a31,600 comes to an end after two years. With this in mind, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the impact that this trial will have on young care-experienced parents and their children when their extra income ends, because I'm genuinely concerned about the negative ramifications that can happen when people who have adjusted their spending patterns and lifestyle to accommodate extra income suddenly find themselves without it? Thank you.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you very much, Joel James, for that question. I know you will anticipate and, I'm sure, be very interested in the interim results from this Cascade\u2014the Cardiff University Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre\u2014independent evaluation. And this is about seeking to understand the impact of the pilot on the lives of care leavers, and, as you know, it runs until 2026, very much engaging with the views and experiences of young people involved in the pilot. And, of course, we have much engagement support around those young people\u2014local authority stakeholders, Voices from Care Cymru, Citizens Advice partners\u2014helping and supporting our young people in terms of overcoming challenges. But also, just from our experience of meeting with the young people, the scope of their ambition, their interest, their determination for their lives to progress as a result of this opportunity they've been given sets them in very good stead for their future\u2014their whole adult life, I'd say. This is about actually seeing if their whole adult life ahead of them could be transformed by this trust and funding and financial support that we're giving to these young people. Yes, of course, already some of those care-experienced young people who are on the pilot will be in this situation\u2014there will be young parents\u2014and they will move on, as all young people do, into adult life. But I think that's a very useful observation in terms of looking at their experience.Can I just say that 50 per cent of young people enrolled have responded to the Your Life Beyond Care survey? That's a really important survey. Obviously, the Deputy Minister for Social Services is responsible for care leavers and care-experienced young people, and I'm delighted that the First Minister launched, with a number of Ministers, the declaration that came from care-experienced young people. And I do urge the Member, and all Members, to look at that declaration, because that declaration came from work that they did themselves\u2014young people\u2014to tell us in Government how they felt we could do better, at local authority and at Welsh Government level, in supporting care leavers at every stage of their young lives.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: It will be no surprise to hear that Plaid Cymru is in favour of the care leavers basic income pilot, and there's pleasure that the pilot is ongoing. That has been replaced by disgust at some of the ways that Tory Members across the floor from me have twisted this policy. To those who are peddling dog-whistle politics reminiscent of Trump, I say this, 'You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.'Minister, I'd like to see the timescale set out by the Government, so that when the results of this trial come back\u2014and I anticipate that they will be positive\u2014there are clear markers rolled out, so that extensive basic income can continue. We cannot afford to let a scheme that could be as transformational as this to drift into the ether.&nbsp;\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Peredur, and such an important question. I'm reluctant to go back\u2014but I will do\u2014to say how shocked we were by this attack on our basic income pilot, which came from ill-informed, inaccurate and misleading information that came from the Conservatives. We are clear about that. It wanted to undermine what we were doing, but, most of all, undermine those young people who are most vulnerable in our nation of sanctuary\u2014our unaccompanied asylum seeker children, who have always been included as eligible. And can I put that on the record again for the basic income pilot? As category 3 care leavers\u2014. I have to say to everyone here, you have all got young people, care leavers, in this pilot. Every single local authority in this Chamber has got care leavers in this pilot. Remember that. And they are, I'm sure, wanting to ensure that we are backing them as they go through this important pilot and, of course, as I've said, the comprehensive detailed research and publishing further monitoring data later on this year.But also, just to say, as to those young people we are supporting, we will want, as you have described very clearly, to support them through every entitlement that they have\u2014every entitlement that they have. And that includes a right to claim asylum in the UK.&nbsp;So, I hope we can move on from that, but also, just to say, as far as our care leavers and care-experienced young people are concerned, they are listening and watching what we are saying in this Chamber, backing them in their prospects\u2014and there are prospects\u2014for their life chances and life opportunities.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Mark Isherwood.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Diolch, Llywydd. Your ministerial responsibilities, as you know, include co-ordination of cross-cutting measures to promote prosperity and tackle poverty. Speaking here last October in the debate on a Member's legislative proposal for a take-up of benefits Bill, I challenged the Welsh Government on the actions it had taken to establish a coherent and integrated Welsh benefits system for all the means-tested benefits it is responsible for, as recommended in the 2019 committee report on benefits in Wales. Last month's Bevan Foundation report on a common approach to Welsh benefits stated that they have long called for a single framework of grants and allowances termed a 'Welsh benefits system', that this system would remove the complex and confusing application process and has the potential to lift people out of poverty. Their findings demonstrate that establishing a Welsh benefits system is feasible in terms of data, that millions of pounds of unclaimed benefits could support those on low incomes, and that the regulations governing Welsh benefits are set by a Welsh Government and so it's within their power to introduce regulatory amendment to facilitate greater uniformity.&nbsp;How do you therefore respond to these findings, and what action are you now taking further to the debate last year and to the report last month? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\n"}

", "options": ["A. The committee decides to forward the petition to the Welsh Government.", "B. The committee decides to keep the petition open.", "C. The committee decides to seek a debate on their report in the Senedd.", "D. The committee decides to close the petition."], "answer": "D", "content": "Jack Sargeant AM: Item 2 on today's agenda is new petitions. For items 2.1 and 2.3, as Chair of the committee, I'm going to use my discretion to bring both of these items together, as they relate to the same topic. Item 2.1 is P-06-1318, 'Exempt A and B roads in Wales from the proposed blanket 20mph speed limit', and item 2.3 is P-06-1322, 'Reallocate the \u00a330m being used for 20mph limits, to the NHS which is in crisis, especially BCUHB!' Item 2.1 was submitted by John Martin Williams and item 2.3 was submitted by Darren Jones.&nbsp;Given the fact this has been debated a number of times in the Senedd, both on the floor of the Senedd and under other matters, as a Petitions Committee we perhaps can't further this work, and this now is a matter again for the floor of the Senedd through individual Members of the Senedd who represent those petitioners. On that basis, I'm going to thank the petitioners for using the process and suggest we close these two petitions this afternoon. Are Members content? I can see all Members are content to close those petitions as suggested.&nbsp;Item 2.2 on today's agendai is P06-1319, 'Provide a pedestrian crossing on A4042 at Goytre Arms crossroads and reduce the speed limit to 20mph':'Make it safe for residents of Penperlleni to cross the A4042 at the Goytre Arms crossroads by providing a pedestrian crossing and extending the existing 20mph speed limit in the village to include this section of the A4042.'This was submitted by Janet Butler, with a total of 656 signatures. At this point, I'll bring committee members in to discuss any actions they may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Could I suggest that we keep this petition open for the time being? There seems to be work under way, and whilst usually these sorts of petitions would be more a matter for the local authority, this is to do with the trunk road network. I notice as well the petitioner has submitted a number of questions; could I also suggest that we forward them on to the Minister as well?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thanks. Diolch yn fawr, Luke, for those suggestions. Are there any comments from Members, or are Members in agreement with Luke Fletcher's suggestion? They are. Okay. We will take that forward and move on.&nbsp;The next petition is item 2.4, P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales':'We call on the Senedd to undertake an inquiry into the prepayment meter scandal. Over the last two months evidence has emerged that thousands of people have been switched to prepay meters without the required checks as to whether they are vulnerable. We at Climate Cymru and other campaigners have been exposing this scandal.'There is additional information available on this petition for members of the committee and members of the public, available online. This was submitted by a former Member of Senedd herself, Bethan Sayed, with a total of 294 signatures. I will bring Buffy Williams in on this petition to discuss any actions we may wish to take.&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I'd also like to thank the petitioner. I can see that the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee has done a large amount of work around this issue and that there are already plans in place to upgrade the sewage system in Brecon, Llanfoist and Usk. I'm not really sure what more we as a committee can do on this petition, so I suggest we close this petition and thank the petitioner again.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: You're ahead one item of business there.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Am I? I'm really sorry, Chair.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: That's okay, Buffy. We're discussing item 2.4, P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales'.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I'm sorry, I am ahead.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: No problem, Buffy.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I am very sorry.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Do you have any comments on that petition?\n\nBuffy Williams MS: One second, so I can get all my papers the right way around. Yes, I've got it here. Sorry. I'm on the right petition now. I know you've done an awful lot of work on this petition, Chair, and I'm used now to hearing you stand in the Chamber and really drive this forward. I think it's a really important petition, and I know that you are driving forward an inquiry on these prepayment meters. So, I think if we leave this petition open and see what comes from the inquiry that our committee is looking to hold, and then go from there.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd.&nbsp;I think we should do a short inquiry into this. I think my inbox, like a lot of other Members'&nbsp;inboxes, is starting to get filled now, and especially with the cost-of-living crisis, it's a particular matter that I think a lot of our constituents are keen for us to get to grips with. So, I would support this committee doing a short inquiry into prepayment meters.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Luke. As Chair and someone who's been campaigning quite heavily on this, it would be, I think, inappropriate for me to push for an inquiry on this, given the fact I would welcome one, so I will remove my comments from today's decision. There has been a suggestion from Buffy and Luke Fletcher to undertake an inquiry, a short piece of work, into this scandal. I look to Altaf Hussain and Rhys ab Owen for agreement on that, or disagreement or further comment. I can see thumbs up and nodding, so I take that as Members' agreement to do this. We will, given that agreement, discuss a way forward and what that might look like in Wales. I know the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee in Westminster are conducting a similar inquiry in their sessions tomorrow.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Item 3 on today's agenda is updates to previous petitions, starting with item 3.1, P-06-1312, 'To help improve water quality in the River Usk by upgrading sewage systems in the Usk valley'. This was submitted by Michael George Cowburn, with 1,612 signatures. I will look to Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. I will go to Buffy Williams in the Rhondda.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: And now this is the right petition. I'd like to thank the petitioner for submitting this petition. It's a really important issue. We have issues in my constituency that are the same. I know ETRA have done a large piece of work around this, and there are plans to upgrade the sewage system in Brecon, Llanfoist and Usk. But again, I'm not quite sure what this committee can do, so I'd suggest that we close this petition and thank the petitioner again.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. I'm a member of ETRA,&nbsp;of course, and we have done a substantial amount of work on this particular issue. I would be with Buffy. I think, just in terms of the nature of this petition, it's more for ETRA to do as a specific subject committee. But could I suggest that we, at least, forward the petition to the committee clerks, and then close?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. That's a valid point, I think, from Luke. Are Members in agreement with Buffy and Luke's suggestions? They are. Okay. We will make sure both the Chair and the clerking team are aware of the petition and the work that we've done to date on that petition.Item 3.2, P-06-1253, 'Ban greyhound racing in Wales'. This was submitted by Hope Rescue with 35,101 signatures in total, with 18,707 of those coming from Wales. This, obviously, was a piece of work we've done an inquiry on, and we debated the committee report in the Senedd on Wednesday last week. Before I move to Members' contributions this afternoon, I should state that there has been a counterpetition, which now has around 6,000 signatures in total and is still collecting signatures at the moment. At the appropriate time that that comes to committee, committee members will consider that petition. But I think it was important to recognise that that petition is currently collecting signatures. At this point, I will move to Members' contributions this afternoon. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just as I begin to make my comments, I'd just like to thank committee members for the work they've been doing on this, but as well to thank both the organisations behind the petition and those who are in favour of racing for giving evidence in the session. I think we struck the chord right in terms of gathering evidence from both sides of the debate. Given that we've had a promise for a consultation from the Minister around greyhound racing, as well as the petition you mentioned earlier, could I suggest that we keep this petition open for the time being, until we have further information on that consultation, or at least a better idea of where the Government is going on this?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch, Luke. Are there any further comments from Members? Buffy Williams.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I'd just like to second everything that Luke has said here. I actually spoke to the League Against Cruel Sports over the weekend. They've also been campaigning on this issue for quite some time, which I actually didn't realise. I think that this is something that we've got to persevere with. Personally, I would just like to continue until we have an outright ban. But that is something personally for me. But I agree with everything that Luke has said.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you for that, Buffy. Are there any comments from Altaf or Rhys? Altaf.&nbsp;\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: I myself would be for a total ban. I would take the point that Luke has made, and I would suggest that we continue with his suggestion.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Altaf, for that. At the stage of debate in the Petitions Committee, we usually consider that the last point of its journey as a petition, but I agree. I think if Members have consensus, given this is a topic that has secured significant debate\u2014not only in the Senedd, but externally as well with the public\u2014and given the fact there is a consultation, which I might encourage those campaigners from both sides of the argument to engage fully with when that is live, and, of course, the counterpetition which has quite quickly, I should say, got to around 6,000 signatures\u2014. I haven't got the figure right in front of me now, but it's around that figure, and still building. I think it is appropriate that we can keep this open and review it, perhaps later on this year, when either the counterpetition comes to committee or the consultation has been launched and closed. I should say I do echo the comments of Luke Fletcher and Buffy as well, and thank those people who helped with the inquiry. It was a useful discussion.Item 3.3, P-06-1323, 'We request that the Welsh Government purchase St David\u2019s Hall as a national resource for Wales'. This was submitted by Ben Herrington, with 3,575 signatures. I'll bring Members in to discuss this position and any actions they may wish to take. Rhys ab Owen.\n\nRhys ab Owen MS: Diolch yn fawr, Gadeirydd. I think we've discussed the Welsh Government's response on at least two occasions\u2014their unsurprising response that they weren't going to purchase St David's Hall, that the funding was not available, and, in any event, there would need to be a substantial five-year plan for them to be able to consider that. I'm not sure whether it would have been the answer for Welsh Government to buy it in any event, but I think that's the only way it could have come before this committee.I think we've postponed making a decision on two previous occasions to await the public consultation from Cardiff Council. I understand that the public consultation had responses from over 1,220 individuals, with the majority\u2014I think, 58 per cent\u2014supporting the council's proposals of having a long-term lease arrangement to manage St David's Hall with Live Nation. Now, obviously, I have major concerns about that, about such an important resource in our capital city being long leased in that way to Live Nation, especially considering the service that St David's Hall has provided to youth music and classical music.Chair, I'm looking to you and the clerking team now, as I'm unsure what more this committee can do, and whether the only option we have at the moment is to thank the petitioner for bringing forward this very important issue to our committee, but our committee's hands are tied at the moment, and that we have no choice but to close this petition. Diolch.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Rhys. Any further comments before I respond? No. Okay. I think you're right, Rhys, that this particular petition has probably reached the end of its journey, but, again, the feeling, obviously, of the public, with this petition itself and a similar petition on change.org, with over 21,000 signatures, clearly shows the strength of feeling. But, given the fact the public consultation from the council has ended that journey, and given the clear steer from the Welsh Government, I think we will have to agree to close this petition and thank the petitioner for using our platform as well. And, of course, I would encourage anyone looking to start a petition in Wales to consider using our platform as well. Any other further comments from Members, or just agreement? Okay.Item 3.4, P-06-1247, 'We call on the Welsh Government to lead the way by supporting trials of a four-day week in Wales'. This was submitted by Mark Hooper, with 1,619 signatures. I will declare an interest at this point; I know other Members will know Mark as well. I know Mark Hooper, the petitioner, myself. We did undertake an inquiry into this particular petition. There were differing views on the committee; I know the Conservative Member, Joel James, who's not here today, had a strong feeling of opposition towards this particular petition. But we did submit our report to the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government have responded to our recommendations. The Deputy Minister for Social Partnership has sent her response back, and in a letter to the committee she has stressed the importance of social partnership and the workforce partnership council, and it is where the Welsh Government will take the proposal to the workforce partnership council at its meeting on 29 March, to consider setting up a working group on a four-day week. And I think it was referenced in that letter by the Deputy Minister that no further decision from the Welsh Government will be taken until that workforce partnership council has either agreed to set up a working group, and, if so, conducted its work there.Given that fact, and given the fact there were differing opinions, not only in this committee, but I remember being one of the early listeners at six o'clock to a BBC Radio Wales phone-in session that had different opinions on this particular petition and the work we've done, can I suggest that perhaps we seek to debate our report in Senedd time and that we'll write to the Business Committee to suggest that? Are Members content with that? They are. Luke Fletcher wanted to come in.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just on the same level as you, I know Mark, so just to declare my interest on that side.But I do think that this is something we should now take to the floor of the Senedd and debate. I completely agree with your proposal, and I just want to take the opportunity to do a shameless plug as well. Next Tuesday, so 21 March, we'll be holding a panel session with Autonomy and 4 Day Week Global in the Senedd, so just an open invitation to those who might be interested who are watching to come along and engage with the panel.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Luke, for that. I'll certainly take an avid interest in that panel discussion, and I'm sure others will as well. Any comments from other Members? No. Okay. On that note, we'll seek to write to Business Committee and of course consider the petition again once we've had a response from them.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Item 4 on today's agenda: we now do conclude our public business of today. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42(ix), that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting, where we will discuss our future work programme, based on two inquiries that this committee is interested in? Are Members content? I can see that they are. Okay, thank you for that. Before I close, just to say that we will meet again on 27 March, and we will now go into private to discuss those items. Diolch yn fawr. Meeting closed.\n"}
{"question": "What\u2019s the relationship between Food Supplements Regulations 2003 and Food Supplements and Food for Specific Groups Regulations 2023?", "evidence": "  Item 4.4, we have a letter from the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being and a statement as well relating to the Food Supplements and Food for Specific Groups (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 2023. This informs us, from the Deputy Minister, about the need for an amending instrument in relation to the above regulations, and the Minister notes that the correcting instrument'addresses an error in the commencement provision'of the original regulations that had rendered them inoperable.  The correcting instrument&nbsp;'also inserts transitional provisions into the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, the Food Supplements (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and the Food Supplements (Wales) Regulations 2003' ", "options": ["A. The later one adds some transitional provisions on the base of the early one.", "B. The later one adjusts some formulations to make them more realistic for 2023 on the base of the early one.", "C. The former has just changed its name, and the actual content is exactly the same as the latter.", "D. They have nothing to do with each other, just the names have some resemblance."], "answer": "A", "content": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: So, under item No. 2, we have instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.2 or 21.3. The first of these is SL(6)316; it's a made negative resolution instrument, the Judicial Offices (Sitting in Retirement\u2014Prescribed Offices and Descriptions) (Wales) Regulations 2023. These regulations prescribe the judicial offices that a person must hold or have held prior to their retirement to be eligible for appointment to a particular sitting in retirement office. Our lawyers have identified three technical reporting points and one merits reporting point, and a Welsh Government response has been received. Do you want to highlight anything on this, Kate?\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Yes, thank you. It was the first two technical points that required a Welsh Government response. The first relates to defective drafting, noting that the heading in the Schedule refers to Part 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act, but the term 'the Act' is not defined anywhere in the regulations, so it's not clear which Act is being referred to. In response, Welsh Government acknowledges that this is an error but says that it does not propose to correct it, because in their view it will be clear enough that the reference is to the enabling Act. Then, the second technical point notes a number of inconsistencies between the Welsh and English texts. Again, Welsh Government agrees that these are errors but they do not propose to make corrections. Members may just wish to note that this is the second such response we've received from Welsh Government recently where they've said that they're not going to correct acknowledged errors. This is valid principle\u2014the obvious error\u2014but it's obviously undesirable to have a lot of errors remaining on the statute book indefinitely. So, it might be something that the committee wants to keep under review should we get further responses.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: There we are. Members are signalling they would want to keep that under review. We have a point of disagreement there, where the Government sees something as self-evident and doesn't need correction, but we will keep this under review. So, thank you very much. We're happy to agree those reporting points.So, we'll go on to item 2.2, regulations SL(6)317, amending the Care and Support (Charging) (Wales) Regulations 2015 and the Care and Support (Financial Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2015, and we have a draft report in our papers as well. The overall stated purpose of these amending regulations is to effect a change to the existing regulations to apply an uplift to the minimum income amount in residential care charging and to reflect new pieces of legislation on financial support schemes. Our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point and we do not require a Welsh Government report on this.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Yes. So, the merits point is simply a matter to note. According to the regulatory impact assessment, local authority supported residents will retain around a third of the uplift in state pension and welfare benefits to spend on personal items, while local authorities will receive an increase in charge income of around \u00a38.3 million per annum.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you very much. Are we happy with that reporting point, happy to agree that? We are.Item 2.3, then, is regulations under SL(6)320, the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2023. We have a draft report and a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services to the Llywydd in your packs. These regulations provide that individuals who have a late application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom under the European settlement scheme, EUSS, but have not been granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status must not be charged for relevant healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under consideration. Our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points to bring to our attention.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Again, these are matters to note. So, the first is the breach of the 21-day rule and the explanation provided by the Minister. The second to note is that there is an element of retrospectivity in the regulations, and this is justified in the explanatory memorandum, and then, finally, there's been no consultation in relation to the regulations.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: There we are. Are we happy to note those in a report on this? We are. Thank you very much. That brings us to our last item in this particular section, item 2.4; it's SL(6)319, the Non-Domestic Rating (Multiplier) (Wales) Regulations 2023, and we have a draft report in our papers. These regulations amend the basis on which the non-domestic rating multiplier is calculated. The regulations apply to the financial year beginning on 1 April 2023, and disapply the use of the consumer prices index for September 2022 when calculating the NDR multiplier. The effect of this is to freeze the NDR multiplier for 2023-24. And one of our colleagues here on this committee, who is the Chair of the Finance Committee, will be relishing getting his teeth into this one as well, I know. So, our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Again, it's three points to note. The first is that the non-domestic rating revenue in Wales is pooled centrally and distributed to local authorities and police and crime commissioners, as part of the annual local government settlements, and that's why the multiplier needs to be determined before the annual settlements can be finalised. The second point draws Members' attention to the paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum highlighting that freezing the multiplier will result in lower bills for rate payers, but it will also reduce income into the non-domestic rating pool for 2023-24. However, this reduction will be fully funded by the Welsh Government, so that there should be no financial impact on local authority or police budgets. And then the final merits point just notes that there was no consultation.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That's really helpful. Any comments on that? Are we happy to agree those points? We are. Thank you, Kate.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: So, that takes on to item No. 3, instruments that raise no reporting issues under Standing Order 21.7. We only have one item under this section today, and it's item 3.1, which is SL(6)318, the code of practice on the exercise of social services functions in relation to Part 4, direct payments and choice of accommodation, and Part 5, charging and financial assessment, of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. The revised code has been amended to reflect a number of new financial support schemes by making an addition to the list of forms of capital that should be fully disregarded in the financial assessment for charging for all forms of care and support. I don't know if there are any issues at all here that you want to flag.&nbsp;\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Nothing. Nothing to note.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No. None. No reporting points on this. Are we happy with that, colleagues? We are. Thank you. So, we agree the reporting points there.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That takes us to item No. 4, notifications and correspondence under the inter-institutional relations agreement, a regular part of our deliberations. Under item 4.1, we have correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd on the inter-ministerial group for environment, food and rural affairs, and we have a letter in our packs of 6 February there from the Minister. So, if I invite colleagues to note the correspondence from the Minister in relation to that inter-ministerial group meeting, held on 23 January, and the letter details for public interest topics of discussion, including the Retained EU Law (Reform and Revocation) Bill, and in particular the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'&nbsp;plans for managing the extensive amount of legislation in the portfolio. The Minister also notes that she requested an update on the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, and that she would be responding to a letter from Lord Beynon on the Animal (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, and the next meeting will be on Monday 6 March. We might want to come back to this in private, but are we happy to note that for now? There we are. Okay.&nbsp;Item 4.2, then, in this section is correspondence from the Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution in respect of the Interministerial Standing Committee, and that letter and the written statement by the Counsel General relate to the most recent meeting of that committee, which was held on 1 February. And again, we're grateful to him for sharing with us the details of the topics of discussion, which included the importance of the Sewel convention and concerns around the retained EU law Bill. The Counsel General also, within the letter, notes that he'raised serious concerns over the suggestion that the UK Government might bring back the Bill of Rights, as well as concerns relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill'as well. So, they obviously had a full agenda there on that day. Again, we can return to these in private session if colleagues want to.&nbsp;Then we have item 4.3, a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services in respect of the UK health Minister's inter-ministerial group, informing us of a meeting on 28 February of the UK Government's health Minister and health Ministers of the devolved Governments. They will be discussing, we are told,'common pressures across the UK national health services and post winter planning and recovery'and they will be issuing a communique after that meeting. And again, this is something that we can return to if we want to in private session.Item 4.4, we have a letter from the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being and a statement as well relating to the Food Supplements and Food for Specific Groups (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 2023. This informs us, from the Deputy Minister, about the need for an amending instrument in relation to the above regulations, and the Minister notes that the correcting instrument'addresses an error in the commencement provision'of the original regulations that had rendered them inoperable. The correcting instrument&nbsp;'also inserts transitional provisions into the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, the Food Supplements (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and the Food Supplements (Wales) Regulations 2003',and the Deputy Minister informs us that she'gave consent to these amendments being undertaken by the Secretary of State as they are required due to oversights in relation to the Miscellaneous Amendment Regulations and they form part of the same policy objectives which those Regulations were made to achieve'.So, if we're content to note that for now.\n"}

To reduce the number of apprentices", "B. To make apprenticeships more difficult to attain", "C. To help apprentices complete their training successfully", "D. To increase the burden on providers"], "answer": "C", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.&nbsp;\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 1. What steps is the Government taking to support people in Arfon who depend on public transport? OQ59390\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for that question. Working with Gwynedd County Council, the Welsh Government has invested significantly in sustaining and improve bus services for the people of Arfon. New CAF trains are already running on north Wales lines. The north Wales transport commission will propose further improvements when it reports in the autumn.&nbsp;\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: Thank you for the response. Constitunents in many communities in Arfon are entirely reliant on bus services to get to work, and they are deeply concerned about all of the uncertainty around the future of bus services. Some communities go from one crisis to another and are fighting hard to maintain a level of service that is inadequate in the first instance. There are constituents in Gerlan, Llys y Gwynt, Tal-y-bont, Deiniolen, Rhosgadfan, Nebo, and so on and so forth, who are at risk of being totally isolated at important times of the day. Unite the Union is calling on you as a Government to arrange an emergency summit to discuss the bus crisis, to include all key stakeholders. Will you acknowledge the gravity of the situation, and will you please arrange a summit as a matter of urgency?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those points. The problem for people who rely on public transport is that many other people haven't returned to bus or train services since the COVID pandemic. Taxpayers, through the Welsh Government, have provided millions of pounds in additional funding to support public transport, but the funding raised though bus tickets is still much lower, and there is a new reality there that we have to face.The Deputy Minister has already met, last week, with people in this area\u2014the bus companies and members of local authorities and so forth, and, of course, we are continuing to discuss these issues with the unions. The Deputy Minister has heard what the Member has said this afternoon about a summit. If that would be useful, of course, we would be prepared to speak to people in that kind of forum. But discussions are ongoing to plan for the bus services of the future in this new context.\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I support Si\u00e2n Gwenllian in raising this important issue here today. And, First Minister, I'm sure you will recognise also that, during the summer months, north Wales brings in a huge number of visitors, which certainly boost our communities through creating jobs and prosperity. Indeed, your own figures show that north Wales tourism day visits are around 22.7 million every year. And one of the things we desperately need during that peak season is increased provision of public transport. To me, it's unacceptable that parts of north Wales, whilst welcoming those many visitors, are having to work with a skeleton public transport system. It's not fair on the people who live there, as well as the visitors who come to enjoy our part of the world. So, First Minister, I wonder how you will ensure that there is appropriate public transport during the summer months in north Wales as we welcome more people in the summer ahead?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, we do that by continuing to invest in bus services across north Wales, and in the Arfon area, where there is a strong case to do so. So, we continue to fund the key TrawsCymru T2 bus service, linking Bangor, Caernarfon, Porthmadog, Dolgellau and Aberystwyth. The service is due to be re-tendered this year, with a new contract for better services starting in September. And in the direct context of tourism, the Member, I know, will be glad to welcome the funding that has been provided as part of the north Wales metro programme\u2014funding provided to Gwynedd Council to enable them to improve the popular Snowdon Sherpa bus network across the Eryri national park. The result is that, far from a skeleton service, there are now more accessible buses operating across the area seven days a week, linking key towns and visitor attractions, and that's a step change in provision for residents and visitors alike.\n\nCarolyn Thomas MS: First Minister, would you agree that the Tory UK Government is directing a managed decline of the railways in Wales, while Welsh Government is trying to improve services? Having failed to invest in improving our network or give us consequential funding, they are now making performances worse by forcing Network Rail to actively plan a five-year decline, with more real-term cuts in funding, from 2024 to 2027, which is a huge concern. It could take the rail network 10 to 15 years to recover from this setback.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Carolyn Thomas for that very important supplementary question, because it will certainly affect people in Arfon who depend on public transport, because the UK Government, having failed to invest in improving our rail network over many years, are now actively planning to worsen the performance of the rail network under its own control. Network Rail's asset management plans for the next five-year period offer Wales the second worst funding settlement of anywhere in the United Kingdom. There will be a cash-terms reduction, let alone a real-terms reduction, in an era of rampant inflation\u2014there will be a cash-terms reduction in funding available to Network Rail in Wales over the five years from 2024 to 2029. Network Rail's own plan points to an increase in infrastructure failures in Wales and deteriorating assets, which will cause services to be less reliable and less likely to run on time. That is what the UK Government is planning to happen in Wales, and Carolyn Thomas is absolutely right to point to it as an essential context in which the efforts of the Welsh Government to support public transport here has to take place.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the future of the provision of apprenticeships in the construction sector? OQ59414\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the Welsh Government is committed to working with employers and our contracted providers to increase apprentice provision across the construction sector and ensure that apprentices are trained to the highest possible standard.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you for that. It's good to hear that you have committed to working with providers and private companies that do provide these opportunities, because some of those have been in touch with me, expressing great disappointment that it's now not possible to offer level 2 apprenticeships for those who want to follow a career in civil engineering. Now, the entry standards for a level 3 apprenticeship requires a C and a D at GCSE level, where, of course, under level 2, the same requirement didn't exist. Now, the result of that is that it does exclude many people who would have gone on to follow prosperous careers in these sectors. It also places more burden on the providers, the construction companies and the civil engineering companies that provide these opportunities, and some of them tell me that, as a result, they wouldn't be eager to continue. So, can I ask the Government to reconsider this decision, because perhaps on the face of it it might look like a sensible step, but, on a practical level, it will have a negative impact?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I've heard the concerns expressed by some companies in north Wales, but we have reformed the qualifications regime under the leadership of employers in the sector. It was they who suggested the new system that we have, and they have done so because they are of the view that the new system will help the recruitment of apprentices who can complete their training successfully and who bring the practical skills needed to work in the sector. That's the intention behind the new system\u2014to help the sector with people emerging from colleges to complete apprenticeships with the skills that they can use successfully. And the problem in terms of recruiting people at level 2 is that evidence shows that they don't, on the whole, do everything that they need to do to be successful in the sector. However, people in the colleges and in the system in north Wales have heard the concerns of some employers up in north Wales, and the Construction Industry Training Board\u2014the board that pulls people together\u2014is going to speak to those companies to see whether there is anything we can do to respond to the problems that they feel that they face.&nbsp;\n\nPaul Davies AM: First Minister, I'm sure you'll agree with me that we need to increase the level of apprenticeships in the construction sector in all parts of Wales, and I'm hopeful that the recent free-port announcement, which is a great example of Governments working together in Wales's best interests, will provide some momentum to provide more opportunities in my constituency and, indeed, across west Wales. Therefore, can you tell us what discussions are taking place with stakeholders to ensure that apprenticeships and, indeed, other vocational skills courses are being made available as part of the free-port programme in Wales?&nbsp;\n\n"}

Disaster prevention and control issues", "C. Medical resource issues", "D. Building safety issues"], "answer": "C", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon, all, and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on the agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is to be answered by the Deputy Minister, and to be asked by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 1. What plans does the Welsh Government have in place to help the young people of Arfon with the costs of traveling on public transport? OQ59096\n\nLee Waters AM: Diolch. One of the aims of 'Llwybr Newydd', the Wales transport strategy, is to reduce the cost of sustainable travel for everyone in Wales, including young people. We are working towards an accessible transport system across the nation and have a number of initiatives aimed at younger travellers.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: It's good to hear that there are plans in the pipeline, and, of course, we need to extend them and to bring new plans forward too. But in rural parts of my constituency, it's not the cost of travelling on buses that's the only problem. There's a lack of bus services in the first instance, with some communities without a way to travel at all at times, because there are no trains, metro, appropriate cycling routes, nor are there bus services at some times of the day. Now, Yr Orsaf in Penygroes is developing a project to support residents, including young people, who face barriers because of a lack of public transport in dyffryn Nantlle, with the support of the dyffryn Nantlle community transport partnership. Is community transport an area that you as a Deputy Minister want to see developing in the future, and, if this is a priority for you, how much funding has been earmarked for encouraging this kind of transport in the Government's draft budget for the next financial year?\n\nLee Waters AM: Thank you. A number of points there. I'm familiar with the work of Partneriaeth Ogwen and have visited some of their schemes\u2014they're an outstanding organisation. I was particularly struck by the scheme we've been funding them for to retrofit bicycles, to add a battery to them, which, particularly in rural areas, particularly hilly areas, is a really practical thing that we can do to help people who don't have easy access to a car or to public transport. We know that, for generations, we've been favouring investment into road schemes, for those people who have cars, and, over time, have been neglecting public transport, and we've seen usage decline, we've seen routes shrink and we've seen fares go up. So, that is one of the reasons why we're bringing forward our bus Bill, to redesign the service, and it's one of the reasons why we'll be publishing the roads review next Tuesday, to, over time, shift resource from car-based schemes to schemes for everyone.In the meantime, we do have some really difficult financial challenges, and we are seeing bus schemes being withdrawn, which illustrates the problem we have with the privatised system, because there is no strategic overview to this\u2014it's being done randomly by bus companies. And then, we have the further problem, particularly in rural Wales, where bus companies are struggling to keep their business model going, and the cost of energy is really stopping them being able to run routes, and they're not tendering for fresh services. So, we have a range of challenges facing us, but the fundamental problem is the lack of investment that we have. Because we have prioritised other things, including as part of the co-operation agreement. We could have chosen to prioritise public transport; we chose other things, and we have to do the best we can with what we've got. But, clearly, as part of our modal shift and the net-zero targets, we need to shift resource far more into public transport.\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I just want to echo the comments raised by the Member for Arfon, and recognise that this important focus is required on public transport, especially for rural areas, in areas like Arfon and across north Wales\u2014the region I represent, of course. Deputy Minister, I'm sure you are an avid reader of the Welsh Conservative manifesto, especially the one for the 2021 Senedd elections. In that, we as Conservatives called for free bus travel and discounted rail travel for 16 to 24-year-olds, to help our young people access education, training and employment. This of course could embed that modal shift that you and I are so keen to see, whilst also supporting our environment, so importantly. So, in light of this, Minister, what consideration have you and the Welsh Government given to this type of idea, to see that free access to buses for our young people, so we can see that modal shift whilst also supporting our environment? Thank you very much.\n\nLee Waters AM: Well, there's no doubt that, if we had lower prices, we'd have higher use. There are schemes right across the world, including free bus use in Normandy and elsewhere, and free bus schemes in Wales, in Cardiff and Swansea and Newport, for short periods, which have shown an uptake in usage. So, we know that, when fares drop, people are more likely to use it. There's no shortage of opportunities and ideas to increase usage and to reduce fares, and incentivise people to use public transport. The challenge always is the resource. So, I'm not sure how the Conservatives plan to fund that initiative that they had in their manifesto, but there are no easy options that I'm aware of to do just that.We do have an offer on buses where people aged between 16 and 21 have a third off an adult bus ticket, and we've been doing a lot of work, as part of our commitment to a fairer fares regime, to model what we could achieve if we had much lower bus fares. And the figures are all very encouraging; the resource is the challenge.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: 2. What support is the Welsh Government providing for coastal communities facing the threat of flooding? OQ59079\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Janet. The Welsh Government is investing \u00a3293 million in reducing flood risk to coastal communities across Wales through our coastal risk management programme. This will reduce flood risk to over 15,000 properties, and includes, for example, more than \u00a319 million of investment in Aberconwy. An interactive map showing our investment is published online.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Minister. I'm sure you're aware that, in 2014, our lovely sandy beach, north shore, Llandudno, received, without any notice, the dumping of some 50,000 tonnes of freshly and dirty quarried rock. At the time, it was described as 'shingle'. The town was in uproar, with residents, visitors and business owners still angry to this day. I can recall our sea washing up a white, milky froth for around three weeks, whilst this was described at the time as 'clean and inert shingle.'&nbsp;Now, in 2023\u2014well, sooner than that, actually\u2014we're now aware of the several options that have been brought forward to you to bring forward a new sea water flood defence scheme. One of the options is to implement a scheme that would replace sand, and stage 1 was even supported. I cannot overemphasise my immense disappointment that this scheme now will not be supported, as you feel that the cost outweighs the aesthetic benefits of using sand renourishment. Llandudno is the queen of the Welsh resorts, and the jewel in the crown\u2014&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: I'm going to have to call you to ask your question now, because I'm about to ask you to ask your spokespeople questions, of which there are three. So, can you ask your question?\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What steps, Minister, can you take? How do we move forward on this? What steps will you take to ensure that we have the right sea defences we need, but that, at some stage, we can see our sandy beach restored in Llandudno? Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nJulie James AM: Yes, thank you, Janet. So, just to be really specific, the Welsh Government have recently awarded grant funding to Conwy County Borough Council to develop a full business case for Llandudno, based on maintaining and improving the existing cobble defence on the north shore. The alternative sand option provides no additional flood benefit, at a much greater cost to the coastal risk management programme, and that's the problem. So, whilst I completely understand what you're saying about the sandy beach, the coastal risk management programme is for coastal risk management; it's not for tourist attractions and other aesthetic value. I'm not denying the value of that; I'm just saying that's not what the programme is for.&nbsp;So, if Conwy County Borough Council want to get an alternative sand option at Llandudno north shore, they really need to look for alternative sources of funding. There are some other sources of funding available, but, in all conscience, I cannot take a coastal management programme that's specifically designed to protect places from flooding and use it for a completely different purpose. So, whilst I have some sympathy with what you're saying, this is not the right programme for it. And, you can tell from the amount of money that we've invested around the coast of Wales that we are really trying to get as many properties protected from actual flooding as possible. Clearly, we do try to do that in the most environmentally and aesthetically pleasing way possible, but, in the end, it's down to how many properties we protect. So, I'm sure you'll be able to work with the council to get a better option, but not through this funding model.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Janet Finch-Saunders.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Diolch, Llywydd, and thank you, Minister, Now, there is no denying that the UK Government is taking decisive action to tackle unsafe buildings. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP has sent all developers legally binding contracts that will commit them to pay to repair these unsafe buildings. This contract will see developers commit an estimated \u00a32 billion or more for repairs to buildings that they've developed or refurbished over the past 30 years, and protect thousands of leaseholders living in hundreds of buildings across England.&nbsp;In England, the UK Government is looking to prevent developers from operating freely in the housing market if they fail to sign and comply with the remediation contract. Will you do the same for those operating in Wales who either refuse to sign or breach the terms of the Welsh Government's developers pact?\n\n"}

The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Alun Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAlun Davies AM: 1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the resettlement of people from Ukraine in Wales? OQ59465\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for that question. As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. We continue to support guests, helping them to move on to longer term accommodation, where they can live more settled lives and be supported within local communities.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I'm grateful to the First Minister for that. This afternoon, I think we should also pay tribute to the work of Mick Antoniw, who has united Members across the Chamber in his support for the people of Ukraine over the last period. And the Welsh Government has also, I think, First Minister, demonstrated a real commitment to the people of that country. It has both condemned Putin's illegal invasion, the barbaric war crimes that have been committed against the Ukrainian people, and it has also reached out its hand of friendship to those Ukrainians who are seeking to escape the consequences of Putin's war.&nbsp;In Blaenau Gwent, First Minister, over 130 people have initially been resettled in the county borough. We're also looking at how we can ensure that there is additional support for those people who are seeking to make their homes again in Blaenau Gwent. The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine. Will the First Minister assure me this afternoon that the Welsh Government will continue this support for the people of Ukraine, as we continue to support the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Putin's invasion?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for what he has said about the success of the programme here in Wales. I'm sure Members would want me to recognise as well the part that he has played in making sure that goods from Wales reach families in Ukraine, where war crimes continue to be committed right up to today. I thank the local Member for Blaenau Gwent for what he has said about the success of the scheme in that county borough. It has been a genuinely outstanding success. Workers in Blaenau Gwent local authority's support team have done an outstanding job in helping people from Ukraine, who came first of all to the welcome centre, to be able to move on to longer term accommodation, whether that is within Blaenau Gwent itself, which has welcomed many Ukrainian citizens into that move-on accommodation, or whether it's work with neighbouring local authorities. Indeed, Llywydd, so successful has the Blaenau Gwent team become that we have asked them to take a national lead in assisting other local authorities in that move-on effort, bringing the expertise that they have developed, the operational skills that they have, to support others to do a similar job. And, of course, the Welsh Government, with the \u00a340 million that we have set aside in our budget for the current financial year to continue to welcome people from Ukraine, forced to flee from their own country, looking for an opportunity to re-establish their lives, will go on working with all our partners to make sure that we offer that hand of friendship, live up to our reputation for being a nation of sanctuary, and do everything we can to help people to re-establish their lives here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: In February, Welsh media reported, and I quote, that,'Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward.'And although the Welsh Government stated it was working closely with local councils to get Ukrainian refugees into longer term accommodation, refugees claimed only one in 100 landlords will take a Ukrainian. And, in March, the British Red Cross warned that better infrastructure is needed to support Ukrainians to rebuild their lives in Wales, and that the Welsh Government should work with the UK Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to establish schemes to help Ukrainians into private rented properties by meeting the upfront costs and acting as guarantors where needed. I know the Welsh Government's still awaiting clarification on the \u00a3150 million resettlement funding from UK Government, but what specific action has your Government taken since then to address these findings? And what figures does the Welsh Government have regarding the number of Ukrainians affected and what has happened to them since?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation. Despite the anxieties that were expressed, indeed, over 1,700 Ukrainian guests have already been moved in Wales on to longer term accommodation. And, in terms of the specific actions that have been taken, of the \u00a340 million that I mentioned a moment ago, Llywydd, \u00a34 million of that is specifically to assist our local authority partners in securing additional move-on accommodation, and that does, indeed, cover some of the points that Mark Isherwood made about assisting people who are able to secure somewhere in private accommodation with some of the upfront costs that you face when you're trying to secure places in the private rented sector. At the same time, we have a major transitional accommodation capital programme mobilised through the Welsh Government: over \u00a376 million used last year to assist local authorities and social landlords to deliver more homes to support all those people who are in housing need. That funding has already delivered nearly 1,000 additional homes, and many people from Ukraine have been able to take advantage of that programme. So, we continue to work closely with our partners, Llywydd. Nobody is suggesting that it is easy to find move-on accommodation in what is already a competitive accommodation market, but I think the success story here in Wales is one that would bear up to scrutiny from anyone.&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: 2. What is the Welsh Government doing to ensure that school leavers have the necessary skills to succeed in the employment market? OQ59496\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Careers and work-related experiences are mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales, and Careers Wales provides support for all schools across Wales to build relationships with employers. Qualifications reform and our employability programmes will prepare young people for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: I'm grateful to you, First Minister, for the answer. I ask the question today in the context of equipping our young people with the skills they need to compete in an increasingly globalised world. And, to that end, it's no coincidence that the countries that produce the best outcomes in terms of maths attainment are often also the countries that have emerging and innovative global economies. And in the UK, I think, sometimes, some of us have a tendency to write off the importance of mathematics. People often joke about not being able to do maths, but that's something we'd never say about reading, for example, so that's something I'm glad that the Prime Minister has correctly identified as a problem that makes us less competitive internationally. And he suggested that further maths learning may be required later on in a young person's education to address the problem. Obviously, there are no one-size-fits-all answers here, First Minister, but, given education is devolved in Wales, and, according to the latest Programme for International Student Assessment results, maths attainment in Wales was the worst of the UK nations, what consideration have you given to what the Welsh Government can do to help turn this situation around and to ensure that school leavers have the maths skills that they need so they can reach their full potential? &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I agree with Tom Giffard about the importance of mathematics. Much of what we do in Wales is to equip young people for the digital skills that they will need for the future in which that aspect of the employment market will become more and more important. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions don't match the rhetoric that we hear from him. He was responsible for the catastrophic Multiply programme when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014\u00a3100 million top-sliced out of money that was meant to come to Wales for a national programme that, I'm afraid, has been a huge failure on the ground. Certainly it has not delivered what was promised here in Wales. I'm afraid the Multiply programme just demonstrates the difficulties when Ministers in Whitehall believe that they are able to design things on the ground in parts of the United Kingdom where they have no reach at all. They designed their Multiply programme without a single word of discussion with the Welsh Government or with the local authorities that are expected to deliver it. As a result, it has not been possible to spend the money that was allocated to Wales. That money is yet to be released to local authorities so that they can do useful things with it, including\u2014and I agree with the importance of the point\u2014to improve numeracy amongst people who are leaving school and people in the workplace who are looking to improve their numeracy skills. So, while I agree on the basic proposition, I cannot agree that the way the UK Government has gone about this has demonstrated a success. In fact, I'm afraid, it is exactly the opposite.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Prif Weinidog, Welsh pupils and young people have such a vast array of skills and talents. In terms of future employment, it benefits everyone for there to be a system in place that allows them to access educational opportunities that actually utilise and play to their own strengths, while ensuring they have the skills for jobs. I know the Welsh Government understands this, so, on that note, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the junior apprenticeship programme pilot, and will we see more pupils across Wales be enabled to access such positive opportunities?\n\n"}

You'll remember that we received evidence from the Minister at the end of the spring term, and we will be hearing from her again at the end of this first stage. But, before us today we have two academics who I'm sure are going to contribute to the scrutiny work, and therefore I welcome Dr Victoria Jenkins, associate professor in law with Swansea University, and Professor Enda Hayes, who is a professor of air quality and carbon management in the University of the West of England. A very warm welcome to you both and thank you for joining us. We'll go straight to questions, and I know that Janet Finch-Saunders wants to ask the first question. Thank you.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, bore da. Is the Bill, as currently drafted, sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in air quality in Wales and soundscapes? And if not, why not?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: Do you want&nbsp;to go first?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: A nice easy question to start. So, air quality and the challenge of dealing with air quality is not new. Since the Environment Act 1995, which is 25 years ago, we've been trying to address this challenge and, to be very honest, we have fundamentally failed. We're very good at diagnosing the problem; we're just not very good at solving it. Now, there are elements of this Bill that I think are going to have a fundamental effect, a positive effect on that challenge. Part of the issues around the Environment Act was the wording of the Act\u2014that you had to work in 'pursuit' of the air quality objectives. We now have got stronger language saying that we have to 'secure' them. So, that's good. Updating of the strategy on a more regular basis, evidence-based targets I think are all really, really positive steps. The bit that worries me is I get a tone from the Bill that we're almost starting from scratch, and we're not. We've got 25-30 years of evidence behind us, which means, I think, we can be a lot more ambitious in terms of the timelines, the targets and how we are going to get there. So, it's Marmite for me at the moment, because there are some bits that I think are really, really good and will solve a lot of the issues and will help us progress in terms of addressing the problems, but it just feels like we can do more.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And we'll come on to some of those individual issues, I'm sure. Dr Jenkins.\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: My interest in this Bill is in relation to how we balance, and my interest generally in terms of environmental law is how we create that balance between giving policy makers and giving Government the discretion to take action to achieve something, but at the same time ensuring accountability. So, that's where I think law may have done us a disservice in the past, and that, moving forward, we need more innovative approaches in that respect. And, from that perspective, I think there are, again, some good bits of this Bill, which are really attempting to put into place a robust framework. I should say I've been an environmental academic lawyer for over 20 years, but I don't specialise in air quality law specifically, so I'm less familiar with the science, but that's why Professor Hayes is here. So, I would say it makes it a little bit trickier for me to talk about the ambition of the Bill in those circumstances, but I'm here to discuss the framework and how it sits today in terms of that balance between discretionary powers and accountability.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Excellent. We will indeed be pursuing some of those points, as well, in a moment, but I'll come to Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I want to go through a specific point right at the outset, which is the scope of the Bill. You touched on the point about starting from scratch. Well, actually, we have various policies in place. One of them is the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013. I declared my interest earlier on there. Now, the active travel group have submitted evidence to this about whether we need to finish some unfinished business that could have been done at the time of the original active travel Act. It's to do with things such as duties to promote active travel, which we've failed to do, et cetera. Now, within the Bill, the Bill addresses two specific, distinct purposes\u2014and my thanks for the briefing note on this\u2014improving air quality, and assessing and managing noise. The cross-party group submission makes the point that Welsh Government state that, in their clean air plan, transport is now the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, predominantly due to emissions from road transport, accounting for approximately one third of emissions, and also, within the explanatory memorandum to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill, it states that our 27 noise maps suggest the homes of more than 200,000 people across Wales are exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organization's 2009 night-noise guidelines, and make the point that the most significant way to deal with this is shifting people away from road use, motorised vehicles, into active travel, walking and cycling, and they suggest some amendments. Have you had time to look at that? Sorry for the extensive preamble, but have you had time to look at that, to express an opinion as to whether you think amendments on active travel would fall within the scope of this Bill? And if you haven't\u2014and I realise you may not\u2014would you be able to go away and have a look at this to see whether you think that those may fall within the scope, because the Llywydd will ultimately have to make a decision on this?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I haven't had a chance to look at it before coming today. I do think that the active travel legislation is significant in the context of air quality and public health, and from my perspective, as an environmental lawyer as well, it's particularly important in bringing together our objectives in Wales in relation to both public health and environmental protection. So, it's certainly, from that perspective, something that I would consider important.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I haven't had a chance to look at it either, but what I would say is that when you're looking at solutions, particularly for transport, active travel is essential. You've got to get to that point. I think, for years, we've been very much orientated in our solutions towards technocentric solutions. So, these are cleaner vehicles, cleaner fuels. That will only get us so far; the scale of the problem here means that we have to look at behavioural interventions, which means getting more people out of vehicles, onto bikes, and out of cars. That's a given. There are a lot of things you have to address to get around that: affordability, accessibility, reliability\u2014all those things that come with public transport\u2014and safety issues around active travel infrastructure, things like that. It's essential. If we're going to solve this problem, then we've got to deal with it.The other point that I might add, if I may, is that what we're dealing with here is a public health issue. It's a public health issue. So, if you're looking at active travel interventions, those interventions will have the core benefits of also working towards better public health. So, it isn't just about improving air quality; it's also the benefits you get elsewhere. So, it's essential, in my mind.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Rather than delay the committee, then, Chair\u2014and thank you for those answers; so, in principle, you've got no objection and, in fact, you can see the benefits of it\u2014I wonder if I could, perhaps, be cheeky enough to ask you to go away and look at it, perhaps discuss it with colleagues in law and whatever to see whether you think it falls within the scope of the two aims of this Bill.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: Okay.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Janet, did you want to come back in on something? And then we'll come back to Huw.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Thank you, Chair. All it was, when we take evidence during the forming of new Bills, quite often, one thing that comes up is that we haven't collected enough data. Now, you say that we look like we're almost at the start again, but a lot of years have gone before. Has the Welsh Government been proactive in collecting the relevant data so that any Bill going forward will be based on really good evidence, if you like?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I can start there. You can always get more data, is the short answer. You can always have more, it can always be better. Across Wales, if we're looking at air quality monitoring data, we've got a pretty extensive network of monitoring sites. I think, from memory, there are about fortyish continuous analysers run by local authorities, and about 10 to 12 analysers connected to the automatic urban and rural network. There's plenty of data already out there. Now, that can always be improved, and I think the tone of the Bill means that we'll have to think differently about how we monitor. So, at the moment, we've monitored for compliance, we've monitored where we've got problematic areas, where we've got these hotspots, where we've got these risks of exceedances. This Bill, again, seems to be more orientated towards prevention, being more proactive\u2014again, the public health side of the issue\u2014which means we have to think differently about how we monitor in terms of understanding public health, and bringing that air quality, health, deprivation triple jeopardy into the equation. So, we've got plenty to start from; we can always have more, and we will have to think differently because the Bill is orientating our approach slightly differently.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Fine.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Let me come on, then, to ask for your views on the Welsh Government's decision, as it stands, to set air quality targets in regulations rather than on the face of the Bill. And their argument is that this will give greater flexibility to respond to the latest guidance and to futureproof the Bill. Do you have sympathy with that or would you prefer to see air quality targets bang on the face of the Bill?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I think this is a question for me in the sense that, if you say too much on the face of primary legislation like this, then you are impinging your discretion to take action as things proceed and as scientific knowledge and understanding moves on. So, it is often a good idea to create a power to introduce regulations. That said, the issue then becomes, well, to what extent do you give the Government discretion, or the Executive discretion, to bring in those regulations and what's the framework for that. So, currently, there is quite a lot of discretion now given to the Executive in that respect, and that's something that you might want to consider further.\n\n"}

Welcome to you. Thank you very much, StepChange and Citizens Advice, for your written evidence. I'm just about to find my script, which is here. Could you just briefly summarise\u2014? Sorry, Sioned, did you want to\u2014?\n\nSioned Williams MS: Sorry, Chair. I'm also a member of the Bevan Foundation.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Sorry, apologies I didn't see you earlier.So, if you could briefly just tell us what the latest impact of the cost-of-living pressures are, highlighting any particular groups that you think are worst affected. I know this is included in your written evidence, but I think it's really a question of reflecting on how things have changed in the last 12 months or so. I don't know whether, Peter Tutton, you'd like to go first, just as you're online. Welcome, Peter Tutton, of StepChange.\n\nPeter Tutton: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, committee, for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here. Apologies I can't be with you in person and I'm dialling in. But, thanks for having me. I'll see what I can do to help you.So, what's happened? It's been a bit funny over the last year. So, certainly, we can see that the cost-of-living increases are having an impact. So, we started recording towards the end of last year the proportion of clients saying that the cost-of-living increases were significant, and that was about 9 per cent if you go back to the end of 2021. We're up to sort of 22 per cent and rising now. So, clearly, more and more people are being drawn to debt advice specifically because of the cost of living.In terms of who we're seeing, generally speaking it's a continuity from both COVID and also the decade before that debt is still largely about people who have less financial resilience, people who are on lower incomes, disproportionately people like single parents, women in general are disproportionate in our client loads, people with responsibility for children, and renters in particular. So, about two thirds of our clients are renters, which is almost the other way around to the overall tenure occupancy. And, particularly, private sector tenants have become increasingly prominent in our case loads over the last decade, but that seems to be accelerating a bit with the cost-of-living crisis.In addition, over half our clients\u2014. It's a regulatory requirement for us, as we're regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, to look and see whether our clients have additional needs because of vulnerable circumstances, and over half our clients fit into that category. That typically means people who are experiencing some degree of mental ill health or physical ill health or physical disabilities.So, debt is really about at the moment, and has been largely about, people on low incomes, maybe more distant from the labour market, low financial resilience, not much in the way of assets to fall back on, and perhaps extra living costs like childcare and so on, and now, of course, things like fuel costs as well.That all said, one of the things that we have seen over the past year is we're starting to see an increase in households who haven't necessarily had financial difficulties before. So, with many of the people we see, those financial difficulties can repeat because the underlying income vulnerabilities and financial resilience vulnerabilities don't change. But, we're seeing more people, which is one of the things we saw with COVID, who hadn't been in this situation before. Over half our clients are in some form of employment\u2014many of them are low income whilst being in employment\u2014and about 40 per cent are in full-time employment, and that's grown a bit, and the cost of living is certainly putting more people who are higher up the income scale under pressure. So, one of the things we've seen with our existing clients on debt solutions, who are paying their debts over a period of time, over the year we've seen quite a lot of those people having to reduce those payments or ask for payment holidays because of the cost of living. But, at the same time, we're seeing new people come in who actually have got more money. So, in a sense, the cost of living is doing two things. It's pushing people who are already vulnerable to debt further into a place where they're more likely to be negative-budget clients, who are really going to struggle to keep up with the essentials and, perhaps even after debt advice, struggle to keep up with the essentials. But, also, it's pushing up-the-income-scale people who are vulnerable to debt and it's bringing households that, before the cost-of-living crisis, as you might expect, were not vulnerable to debt and did not need debt advice, to debt advice.What we're not seeing over 2021 is a huge spike yet in debt advice demand. So, I think we said last time I gave evidence to you, about COVID, that one of the oddities of COVID was that debt advice demand actually dropped, for a number of reasons that we understand better now than we did then. We have seen a steady increase in debt advice demand over 2022, and certainly in early January this year we've had some high numbers. So, we had days in January that were higher than any day last year in client demand.So, we're not yet seeing the explosive increase in client demand that we saw, for instance, in 2008-09 following that recession, but, typically, there is a lag between people falling into difficulty and seeking debt advice. So, about half our clients say that they've been struggling with their debts and worrying about their finances for a year or more before seeking debt advice. There are a number of barriers to people seeking help, and there are a number of ways that people try and manage their financial difficulties before coming to debt advice, most worryingly by juggling bills and borrowing, which can make the harm of debt worse when they actually do come to debt advice in the end.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you for that comprehensive reply. I don't want you to repeat the same information, but I think what it would be useful to know is really what impact it's having on debt levels, because, as Mr Tutton said, if people are borrowing money, then we're into a very dangerous situation that it's very difficult to emerge from. Steffan, do you want to go first?\n\nDr Steffan Evans: Yes, thanks. So, we've got some brand new data I can share with you today. So, the reason we didn't share written evidence was that we had a poll go to the field two weeks ago today, with YouGov. So, we had the results through last Friday, and we're launching the report on Thursday, so we'll share a written copy with you once that's written up. But I've taken the time to go through the data on debt, and what we're seeing maybe feeds into what Peter was saying there that the headline levels of debt, actually, seem pretty stable in terms of the proportion of people who are reporting back they're in debt. So, this is the third survey in a row. So, there was one towards the tail end of 2021, one in summer 2022, and then this one where, in terms of the proportion of people saying that they're in debt, it hasn't really changed much in our survey. So, 13 per cent of people were saying that they were in more than one month\u2019s worth of arrears, and 28 per cent of people were saying that they'd borrowed money over the last three months to manage the cost of living. So, that does suggest maybe that those extra payments we've seen, that extra support, has stabilised in terms of the sheer number of people. But, of course, what that doesn't tell us is that, for those in debt, has the nature of that debt changed. Have they gone deeper into debt, et cetera?What we do know from it and what we've been breaking down is that there are groups that are at far, far greater risk of living in debt\u2014many of the ones that Peter\u2019s already mentioned. I think one that really jumped out at me was that over half of people on universal credit borrowed money at some point in the last three months. That was one of the things that came out of the survey. And, interestingly, 10 per cent of people on universal credit reported that they\u2019d had a loan from the Government\u2014so, a kind of budget advance, or something like that. They're quite unique in terms of that being a source of debt as well. Although, of course, friends and family, credit cards, et cetera, are bigger sources. In terms of the other groups, renters and disabled people feature very, very prominently, and households with children. And we definitely do see a skewing towards younger working adults. So, adults under 50 seem to be more likely, in our survey responses, to report that they've either fallen behind on a bill, or that they've borrowed money, than adults over 50. So, that's kind of a headline finding.Carers as well are a group that we've got some data on for the first time, and, again, they seem to be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a group that's more likely to fall into debt. So, that link between groups that were most likely to live in poverty, most likely to struggle with debt before, are absolutely the groups of people where we're seeing huge proportions of them reporting that they're in debt.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. We'll come back to the detail on this in a moment. So, the Citizens Advice graph, which tells more than 1,000 words, really highlights the impact of the removal of some of the Welsh Government support. So, I wondered if you could just briefly summarise how you think that is going to impact on the sort of work your organisation is doing, Luke Young.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Young: Of course, Chair. As Members will have seen the graph, which does tell the story, we are in a situation where the choices that the Welsh Government made last winter and this winter have better protected people in Wales this winter. The UK Government and Welsh Government support have helped a large group of people with direct funding and direct payments over the last few months. For lots of those groups who were eligible, that has kept them afloat this winter. We're now looking, though, at a situation where the Wales fuel support scheme will not be in the next budget, and UK Government support will reduce alongside the energy guarantee, alongside rising prices.&nbsp;And so, what our modelling shows is that we see rising expenses on households and not enough income to cover it. One of the key things we've seen in the last year, just to add to the conversation around debt, is that the average energy debt for Citizens Advice clients in Wales rose last year from \u00a31,114 to \u00a31,419. Now, some of that extra pressure on those particular households will have been covered by Government support, but, with everything else, as both my colleagues have said, things are going in the wrong direction. And so, we worry that, in a few months' time, we will be seeing lots more people for crisis debt support. &nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Can I bring in Jane Dodds, who wanted to follow up?\n\nJane Dodds MS: Yes, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the graph. You talked about the Citizens Advice graph in the report. One of the things that I wanted to talk about is the fact that it appears that the council tax arrears\u2014so, the amount that people pay in council tax\u2014is the highest increase. And I was interested in hearing more about exactly how it works with local authorities, because I understood that they weren't putting pressure on people who are in arrears with regard to their council tax.&nbsp;So, could you just take us through that graph a little bit, please, if that's okay, Chair?\n\n"}

Mark Alexander"], "answer": "A", "content": "Darren Millar AM: So, we'll got straight to item 2 on our agenda, the Agriculture (Wales) Bill Stage 2 consideration. We're undertaking Stage 2 proceedings today for the Agriculture (Wales) Bill. We have the Minister with us today, Lesley Griffiths, and her officials. Would you like to just introduce your officials for the record?\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly. Thank you, Chair. So, over on my left, I have Emma Davies, who is the agricultural Bill manager and Dorian Brunt, who is the senior lawyer for the rural affairs team. And on my right, Hannah Fernandez, head of policy instructions for the Bill, and Mark Alexander, deputy director for land management reform.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you for that, Minister, and welcome to you all.So, the marshalled list of amendments is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled, marshalled into the order that has been agreed by the committee on 16 February. The groupings list shows how amendments have been grouped in order to facilitate the debates today, and the order in which the amendments are called and moved for a vote is dictated by the marshalled list.&nbsp;So, I want to\u2014. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair, I will move the amendments in the name of the Minister, and for expediency, I will assume that the Minister wants to move all of the amendments that have been tabled in her name at the appropriate time, in accordance with the marshalled list. Minister, if you don't&nbsp;want me to do that, then please indicate at the relevant point in the proceedings.So, in line with our usual practice, we've got legal advisers to the committee who are present today and that means that we can suspend proceedings should Members wish to take advantage of that at any time\u2014that legal advice. And in addition, Minister, you can also receive advice, of course, from your officials, hopefully by passing a note, of if you wish to do so, we can suspend proceedings as well, should you need us to do that.\n\nDarren Millar AM: So, we'll start with group 1 of the 16 groups that we have to discuss today: the sustainable land management objectives and the first group of amendments that we're going to be discussing. The lead amendment in this group is amendment 57. I therefore call on Luke Fletcher to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group. I call on Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd, and I move the amendments. And right off the bat, I'd just like to thank the clerks and legal team for their patience with myself as a new Member in going through this process.I'll speak to amendments 57, 1A, 3 and 4. On amendment 57, this amendment seeks to include a requirement relating to protecting food security in SLM objectives. Food security is a critical issue. It directly impacts the health and well-being of people, the environment and economy. Wales has a high level of poverty and food insecurity, particularly among low-income households, which can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Sustainable land management can help to address this issue by promoting the production of nutritious, affordable and locally grown food.&nbsp;Although clause 1 within the Bill includes the production of food as part of the first SLM objective, what we are seeking to do is to provide a clear target for meeting this objective, which must be around ensuring the food security of citizens and access to food to promote good health and well-being.On amendment 1A, which is an amendment, actually, to amendment 1, we're seeking to change 'farmer' to 'active farmer' to ensure that we are clear as to who receives support.On amendment 3, economic resilience is just as important to Welsh farmers as environmental resilience because it is essential for their long-term sustainability and ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions. By investing in both economic and environmental resilience, farmers can build a sustainable and profitable farming operation that can withstand the challenges of the future.And finally, Chair, on amendment 4,&nbsp;'The fifth objective is to seek to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities, recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and agricultural production to the rural economy, and in doing so\u2014'(a) to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and'(b) to contribute to achieving the well-being goals in section 4 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.'\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Luke. I call on Sam Kurtz.\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd like to echo Luke Fletcher's thanks and praise to the legal team and the clerking team for their hand-holding through this process. I am most grateful for that. Speaking to amendment 1, it has been tabled in order to remove any ambiguity in relation to the sustainable land management objective 4. By precisely linking the fourth objective to the role of the farmer, we seek to recognise their integral role in supporting and delivering the objectives of the sustainable land management objective 4. This sits in line with recommendation 10 of the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee report into the Agriculture (Wales) Bill, which seeks to provide explicit policy intent for the support of strong and vibrant rural communities, as was sought by key industry stakeholders.&nbsp;Touching on amendment 1A, I would like to welcome this from Luke Fletcher, and therefore will be supporting it. In relation to amendment 43, the inclusion of the phrase 'landscape' has been made in order to remove any ambiguity about the land we seek to conserve, enhance and promote, as outlined within the fourth objective of this legislation, making it more explicit than 'countryside' alone\u2014indeed, looking at every form of land, be that mountains, uplands, moorlands, seascapes, semi-urban areas, et cetera. So, through recognising this, we also seek to acknowledge that each category possesses its own unique, distinctive character and, with that, separate necessities that require tailored support and assistance.Speaking to amendment 2, the use of the phrase 'existing' has been chosen to, once again, remove any ambiguity as to what farmers should be seeking to promote\u2014in this instance, public access within land designated for agricultural purposes. I'm sure that the Minister will be familiar with the reservations that some have made with regard to public access, especially should that be land that is home to farm animals. What this amendment seeks to do is secure existing public access and provide landowners with a key objective through which they can seek to enhance existing access. By permitting this, we can seek to alleviate significant barriers to increasing the public's connection with and understanding of the natural environment.&nbsp;Speaking to amendment 3, this has been tabled to strengthen the fourth objective in order to recognise the significance of rural economic viability through the means of protecting farm businesses. By protecting, enhancing and promoting the countryside and landscape, cultural resources and public access, we encompass the wider role of the rural economy, sustaining its viability. This amendment seeks to formally recognise that arrangement and enshrine it on the statute book, in line with the aspiration set out within recommendation 10 of the committee report.&nbsp;And finally, Chair, amendment 4 has been tabled with the purpose of introducing a fifth sustainable land management objective, one that seeks to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities through recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and the practice of agricultural production to the rural economy. Land management decisions to achieve the biodiversity, climate and sustainable food objectives cannot be divorced from the economic and social needs or influences that farming families and food supply chain businesses experience. Therefore, we are highly unlikely to achieve our aims at the scale and pace required unless we protect and enhance the economic viability of families and communities delivering the outcomes within the sustainable land management objectives. Thank you, Chair.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. Are there any other members of the committee who wish to speak? If there aren't, then I call on the Minister.&nbsp;\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd just like to begin by thanking Members for their remarks, for their amendments to the Bill and for this opportunity to set out the Government's position regarding them all. I just want to assure Members that both I and my officials have really considered the amendments in detail. Obviously, I'll respond to each amendment in turn and then also introduce amendment 29, which is tabled in my name.Amendment 57: the first amendment in this group alters the first objective so that contributing to the sustainable production of food and other goods is'to protect or improve the food security of citizens and access to food that promotes good health and wellbeing.\u2019Welsh agriculture has a key role to play as the producer of high-quality food, helping to feed our nation and other nations. Food security and access to food that promotes good health and well-being is, however, much, much wider than that, relating to supply-chain considerations, wages, transport, the availability of shops, benefits, healthcare, housing, et cetera. And of course, most of these lie outside the scope of this agricultural Bill, which is why this amendment cannot be accepted.Amendment 1 and amendment 1A, which is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective: the purpose of amendment 1 and amendment 1A appears to seek to limit the fourth SLM objective to farmers, or active farmers only. The concepts of 'farmer' or 'active farmer' do not appear in the Bill, and none of the SLM objectives refer to these terms. So, it's not the policy intention to limit the fourth SLM objective in this way. Introducing this concept now could have unknown consequences for other parts of the Bill. So, for example, a reference in one place of the Bill to a 'farmer' or an 'active farmer' may imply that other parts of the Bill do not apply to the farmer or active farmer. And this is a possible consequence that I'm sure all Members would wish to avoid.&nbsp;Amendment 43: this is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective to refer specifically to landscapes in the countryside, and I don't think this amendment is necessary, as non-urban landscapes are considered to be captured within the term 'countryside', which is already referenced in the fourth objective.&nbsp;Amendment 2 to the fourth SLM objective would limit scope of public access under that provision to what is existing only. Public access is not static, it changes through the actions of farmers and landowners, and others updating access rights. So, restricting action to existing public access is therefore contrary to the policy intention to promote public access to the countryside and our cultural resources.&nbsp;Amendment 3: as I've just mentioned, none of the SLM objectives refer to farmer or any other beneficiary or actor. So, it's therefore not appropriate to include a reference to protecting their economic viability.Amendment 4: this amendment introduces a new SLM objective that is not required. Having resilient agriculture businesses that contribute to our thriving rural communities and help sustain current and future generations of farmers is important. And the intention of this amendment appears to seek to ensure that the Government, potentially, underwrites rural livelihoods, which is outside of the scope of the Bill, and not appropriate. It would also exclude non-rural communities, where agriculture and ancillary activities may take place. And the proposed Government amendment 29 recognises the importance of agricultural businesses in the communities in which they operate.Amendment 29, I'm very pleased to bring this forward, it is the result of productive discussions with Plaid Cymru, as part of the co-operation agreement. The amendment makes provision about factors relevant to determining whether food and other goods are produced in a sustainable manner for the purposes of the first SLM objective. The amendment is intended to highlight the link between the production of food and other goods in a sustainable way, and the resilience of agricultural businesses within the communities in which they operate. Resilient agricultural businesses are vitally important to Wales, contributing to our thriving rural communities, and sustaining Welsh agricultural land for our future generations. Businesses that are resilient and adaptive are more likely to thrive and survive shocks to the sector, such as those we've seen caused by pandemics, conflicts, supply chain issues and climate change. So, I therefore ask that Members agree my amendment 29, and do not agree amendments 57 and 1A in the name of Luke Fletcher, and amendments 1, 43, 2, 3 and 4 in the name of Sam Kurtz. Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Minister. I call on Luke Fletcher to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd. It's naturally disappointing that the Government won't be supporting our amendments. On amendment 57, I think it's important to note that, with the other sustainable land management objectives having much more of an environmental and social focus, it is vital that the sustainable land management objective has clarity around the food production and food security goals. Chair, I propose that we move to a vote.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. So, the question is that amendment 57 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] There is an objection, so we'll proceed to a vote. Those in favour, please raise your hands. And those against. So, I can see that there's a tied vote, so I use my casting vote in the negative, that is, against the amendment, in accordance with Standing Order 6.20(ii). Therefore, amendment 57 is not agreed.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Luke Fletcher, before we dispose of amendment 1, we need to dispose of the amendment to that amendment, which has been tabled in your name\u2014amendment 1A. Do you move that amendment?\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: I move.\n\n"}
{"question": "What were some of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on local authorities in Wales, according to Christina Harrhy?", "evidence": "  1. \"The big difference here is that throughout COVID the Welsh Government helpfully provided us with some short-term funding... And as Llinos has already mentioned, as we're coming out of COVID, there's increased demand, but it's not only increased demand, it's increased complexity of demand.\"  ", "options": ["A. Decreased demand for services", "B. Increased complexity of demand", "C. Reduced workforce", "D. Increased funding from the Welsh Government"], "answer": "B", "content": "John Griffiths AM: We will move on to item 2 on our agenda today, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our first evidence session with the Welsh Local Government Association. So, let me welcome our witnesses, then: Councillor Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council and leader of the Welsh Local Government Association; Anthony Hunt, leader of Torfaen County Borough Council; Councillor Llinos Medi, leader of Anglesey county council; Christina Harrhy, chief executive of Caerphilly County Borough Council; and Chris Llewelyn, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association. So, croeso, welcome to you all.Perhaps I might begin, then, with some general questions by way of an overview, and firstly, then, for the Welsh Local Government Association to provide a brief overview of the current financial situation facing local authorities in Wales. Andrew, I guess that's you.\n\nAndrew Morgan: Thank you, Chair. If I can just start, and perhaps I'll hand over to my colleagues. I think it's fair to say that the pressure this financial year and going into the next financial year is on a scale that, certainly in my time of being a councillor, which is since 2004, we've not faced. In terms of double-digit inflation, it's bad enough, but there obviously is the pressure on the pay award, which is agreed across England and Wales, which is considerable this year, but not least as well in terms of energy costs and supply chain costs. If you consider food costs for things like school meals, our care home services and meals on wheels, food costs have gone up anything between 14 and 25 per cent. Our gas and energy costs are predicted for this financial year for local authorities in Wales to go up around 355 per cent for gas, and well over 100 per cent for electric. So, there are some real pressures on local authorities. I know every year we talk about the pressures on local government, whether it's service demand such as social services in particular, but this year I think it is quite exceptional.Local government is facing a significant overspend this year\u2014in excess of \u00a3200 million is the figure that we have collated between the 22 authorities. I think it's fair to say that since devolution, local government has never overspent \u00a3200 million in a single financial year. My own authority is set to overspend by around \u00a320 million this year, so we'll be using reserves, and most local authorities are looking to use reserves. And next year, even though we are having a very good settlement from&nbsp;the Welsh Government, and we are grateful for the additional funding that's been passported on, there is going to be significant pressure on local authorities to set a balanced budget. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Andrew. Any other of our witnesses? Anthony.&nbsp;\n\nAnthony Hunt: Thank you, Chair. The pressures are substantial. We estimate \u00a3784 million cumulatively to the end of the next financial year. Just in social care, for example, it's \u00a395.2 million of pressures, \u00a332 million from children's residential placements, adult residential placements \u00a312 million, adult domiciliary care \u00a37.5 million. Just to use my own authority as an example, our energy costs are estimated to rise by \u00a34 million, our social care costs by \u00a34 million, and our pay bill by just over \u00a37 million. Those are real pressures that can't just be managed away easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Would any other of our witnesses like to add anything to what Andrew or Anthony have said? Llinos.&nbsp;\n\nLlinos Medi: I think in addition to the cost pressures and inflation is the service demand as well that we're seeing a massive increase in, due to the cost-of-living crisis. So, it's a perfect storm of the demand on services and the cost of delivering the services at the same time.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Diolch yn fawr. In terms of the experience during the pandemic, where, obviously, local authorities again were under tremendous pressure, how would you compare the current situation with the situation at that time? Who would like to offer a view on that? Christina.&nbsp;\n\nChristina Harrhy: I think that the big difference here is that throughout COVID the Welsh Government helpfully provided us with some short-term funding. And as Llinos has already mentioned, as we're coming out of COVID, there's increased demand, but it's not only increased demand, it's increased complexity of demand. And then when you couple that with the depleted workforce\u2014. Because one of the things that has happened post COVID is that, for a number of reasons, a lot of public servants have decided to leave public service. Coupled with the reduced funding that we are facing, the increased demand and complexity, and a depleted workforce and difficulty in recruiting and retention, I think it's essentially a perfect storm. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Christina. Llinos.&nbsp;\n\nLlinos Medi: I will be speaking in Welsh; I didn't use the interpretation earlier. It's also important that we note that during COVID, normal services had a period where they weren't necessarily being provided, so we were focused on the COVID crisis. Now, we have a cost-of-living crisis on top of all the other crises hitting society, as well as the financial crisis that we as an authority are facing. But planning expectations continue, and public protection and all the other requirements placed upon us as an authority remain, and we can't cope with all of these crises as well as business as usual and public expectation on local authorities. And much of that, of course, is statutory, for example planning and so on. So, the pressure now is more intense because of that.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Diolch yn fawr, Llinos. Andrew, did you want to come in as well?\n\nAndrew Morgan: Yes, just to add to and support what Christina Harrhy said. Obviously, during the pandemic, we did receive extraordinary amounts of funding, both to support communities and to support services, and certainly end-of-year funding as well, which has obviously helped our balances, carrying forward to this year, which has now helped us in terms of overspends. But the difficulty is of course that that was an exceptional amount of funding, and one-off funding, to deal with the short-term problem. In effect, the pandemic was a short-term hit for things like income, which has largely recovered in lots of areas, though there are some legacy issues there. But going forward now, general revenue, in terms of our revenue budget, is under massive pressure from four key drivers\u2014the inflation, the energy costs, the service demand, and pay pressures. All of them are almost like a perfect storm for public services across the board, and local authorities are no different.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much for that. Obviously, the potential impact on services is something that all of us will be very concerned about. Is there anything in particular you would like to say in terms of that potential impact? Is there anything that you'd like to highlight? Andrew.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew Morgan: Every local authority will have to address this, obviously, as part of their budget-setting round and the various consultations they're doing. But even though we've had a relatively good settlement, it has to be said\u2014the average figure is much more positive than was anticipated, with consequentials being passed on\u2014there is a range from the low end, such as authorities like myself and Merthyr, to, I think, Monmouthshire, which is at the higher end this year, and Cardiff. So, there is obviously fluctuation in the formula, but the formula is there because it is driven by demand, such as population, school numbers, and various other drivers, which impact on that.But turning back to individual councils setting their budgets, there's no getting away from the fact that there will be some tough decisions. There is a balance to be struck between council tax increases at a significant rate, making savings where possible without impacting on services, but, undoubtedly, there will be other cuts to services, or service changes that, I think I'm fair in saying, all 22 local authorities will have to consider to a certain extent. That may be changing things like bin services, it could be cutting or closing some sports facilities; there is a whole raft of things that local authorities are considering, but it is obviously down to those individual authorities to make those tough decisions.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Okay. Llinos.\n\nLlinos Medi: I know that you're already aware of this, so I don't want to be\u2014. But this is us making cuts to services that have previously been cut, so the options are very few and far between. And when we've been able to maintain some semblance of service in some areas, it may mean that may have to disappear, and clearly that's a real cause of concern. So it's important to note that we weren't in an ideal starting point. I sometimes fear that we forget about the decades of cuts that we've undertaken already.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Anthony.\n\nAnthony Hunt: I just wanted to come back to the point that Christina made about workforce\u2014that's a very important one, looking to the medium term. This isn't just a cash issue, this is an issue with more and more people deciding to walk away from public services. They've seen their pay depleted by 20 per cent over the past decade, they're expected to continually do more with less, with fewer staff, and I really feel that we're staring in the face of a recruitment crisis within some key public services. We're seeing it in social care, in domiciliary care, and we're seeing it actually in more areas than I've ever seen before, where we're really struggling to recruit to key posts. And after all, public services are the sum total of the people who work in them, so I think that's an issue that we have to look into as well.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thanks for that. We will come on to these matters in a little more detail later on. Before I bring in other committee members, could I just ask one further question? I think it was Llinos who mentioned that demand is obviously significant, and so have others of you. We hear reports that Welsh Government, in response to the pressures that hospitals face, and emergency services face, will be encouraging discharges from hospital perhaps without care packages being fully in place at that stage. Is there anything that you'd like to say about that in terms of the potential pressure on local authority services? Andrew.\n\n"}

For items 2.1 and 2.3, as Chair of the committee, I'm going to use my discretion to bring both of these items together, as they relate to the same topic. Item 2.1 is P-06-1318, 'Exempt A and B roads in Wales from the proposed blanket 20mph speed limit', and item 2.3 is P-06-1322, 'Reallocate the \u00a330m being used for 20mph limits, to the NHS which is in crisis, especially BCUHB!' Item 2.1 was submitted by John Martin Williams and item 2.3 was submitted by Darren Jones.&nbsp;Given the fact this has been debated a number of times in the Senedd, both on the floor of the Senedd and under other matters, as a Petitions Committee we perhaps can't further this work, and this now is a matter again for the floor of the Senedd through individual Members of the Senedd who represent those petitioners. On that basis, I'm going to thank the petitioners for using the process and suggest we close these two petitions this afternoon. Are Members content? I can see all Members are content to close those petitions as suggested.&nbsp;Item 2.2 on today's agendai is P06-1319, 'Provide a pedestrian crossing on A4042 at Goytre Arms crossroads and reduce the speed limit to 20mph':'Make it safe for residents of Penperlleni to cross the A4042 at the Goytre Arms crossroads by providing a pedestrian crossing and extending the existing 20mph speed limit in the village to include this section of the A4042.'This was submitted by Janet Butler, with a total of 656 signatures. At this point, I'll bring committee members in to discuss any actions they may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Could I suggest that we keep this petition open for the time being? There seems to be work under way, and whilst usually these sorts of petitions would be more a matter for the local authority, this is to do with the trunk road network. I notice as well the petitioner has submitted a number of questions; could I also suggest that we forward them on to the Minister as well?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thanks. Diolch yn fawr, Luke, for those suggestions. Are there any comments from Members, or are Members in agreement with Luke Fletcher's suggestion? They are. Okay. We will take that forward and move on.&nbsp;The next petition is item 2.4, P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales':'We call on the Senedd to undertake an inquiry into the prepayment meter scandal. Over the last two months evidence has emerged that thousands of people have been switched to prepay meters without the required checks as to whether they are vulnerable. We at Climate Cymru and other campaigners have been exposing this scandal.'There is additional information available on this petition for members of the committee and members of the public, available online. This was submitted by a former Member of Senedd herself, Bethan Sayed, with a total of 294 signatures. I will bring Buffy Williams in on this petition to discuss any actions we may wish to take.&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I'd also like to thank the petitioner. I can see that the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee has done a large amount of work around this issue and that there are already plans in place to upgrade the sewage system in Brecon, Llanfoist and Usk. I'm not really sure what more we as a committee can do on this petition, so I suggest we close this petition and thank the petitioner again.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: You're ahead one item of business there.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Am I? I'm really sorry, Chair.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: That's okay, Buffy. We're discussing item 2.4, P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales'.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I'm sorry, I am ahead.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: No problem, Buffy.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I am very sorry.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Do you have any comments on that petition?\n\nBuffy Williams MS: One second, so I can get all my papers the right way around. Yes, I've got it here. Sorry. I'm on the right petition now. I know you've done an awful lot of work on this petition, Chair, and I'm used now to hearing you stand in the Chamber and really drive this forward. I think it's a really important petition, and I know that you are driving forward an inquiry on these prepayment meters. So, I think if we leave this petition open and see what comes from the inquiry that our committee is looking to hold, and then go from there.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd.&nbsp;I think we should do a short inquiry into this. I think my inbox, like a lot of other Members'&nbsp;inboxes, is starting to get filled now, and especially with the cost-of-living crisis, it's a particular matter that I think a lot of our constituents are keen for us to get to grips with. So, I would support this committee doing a short inquiry into prepayment meters.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Luke. As Chair and someone who's been campaigning quite heavily on this, it would be, I think, inappropriate for me to push for an inquiry on this, given the fact I would welcome one, so I will remove my comments from today's decision. There has been a suggestion from Buffy and Luke Fletcher to undertake an inquiry, a short piece of work, into this scandal. I look to Altaf Hussain and Rhys ab Owen for agreement on that, or disagreement or further comment. I can see thumbs up and nodding, so I take that as Members' agreement to do this. We will, given that agreement, discuss a way forward and what that might look like in Wales. I know the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee in Westminster are conducting a similar inquiry in their sessions tomorrow.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Item 3 on today's agenda is updates to previous petitions, starting with item 3.1, P-06-1312, 'To help improve water quality in the River Usk by upgrading sewage systems in the Usk valley'. This was submitted by Michael George Cowburn, with 1,612 signatures. I will look to Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. I will go to Buffy Williams in the Rhondda.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: And now this is the right petition. I'd like to thank the petitioner for submitting this petition. It's a really important issue. We have issues in my constituency that are the same. I know ETRA have done a large piece of work around this, and there are plans to upgrade the sewage system in Brecon, Llanfoist and Usk. But again, I'm not quite sure what this committee can do, so I'd suggest that we close this petition and thank the petitioner again.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. I'm a member of ETRA,&nbsp;of course, and we have done a substantial amount of work on this particular issue. I would be with Buffy. I think, just in terms of the nature of this petition, it's more for ETRA to do as a specific subject committee. But could I suggest that we, at least, forward the petition to the committee clerks, and then close?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you. That's a valid point, I think, from Luke. Are Members in agreement with Buffy and Luke's suggestions? They are. Okay. We will make sure both the Chair and the clerking team are aware of the petition and the work that we've done to date on that petition.Item 3.2, P-06-1253, 'Ban greyhound racing in Wales'. This was submitted by Hope Rescue with 35,101 signatures in total, with 18,707 of those coming from Wales. This, obviously, was a piece of work we've done an inquiry on, and we debated the committee report in the Senedd on Wednesday last week. Before I move to Members' contributions this afternoon, I should state that there has been a counterpetition, which now has around 6,000 signatures in total and is still collecting signatures at the moment. At the appropriate time that that comes to committee, committee members will consider that petition. But I think it was important to recognise that that petition is currently collecting signatures. At this point, I will move to Members' contributions this afternoon. Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just as I begin to make my comments, I'd just like to thank committee members for the work they've been doing on this, but as well to thank both the organisations behind the petition and those who are in favour of racing for giving evidence in the session. I think we struck the chord right in terms of gathering evidence from both sides of the debate. Given that we've had a promise for a consultation from the Minister around greyhound racing, as well as the petition you mentioned earlier, could I suggest that we keep this petition open for the time being, until we have further information on that consultation, or at least a better idea of where the Government is going on this?\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch, Luke. Are there any further comments from Members? Buffy Williams.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: I'd just like to second everything that Luke has said here. I actually spoke to the League Against Cruel Sports over the weekend. They've also been campaigning on this issue for quite some time, which I actually didn't realise. I think that this is something that we've got to persevere with. Personally, I would just like to continue until we have an outright ban. But that is something personally for me. But I agree with everything that Luke has said.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you for that, Buffy. Are there any comments from Altaf or Rhys? Altaf.&nbsp;\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: I myself would be for a total ban. I would take the point that Luke has made, and I would suggest that we continue with his suggestion.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thank you, Altaf, for that. At the stage of debate in the Petitions Committee, we usually consider that the last point of its journey as a petition, but I agree. I think if Members have consensus, given this is a topic that has secured significant debate\u2014not only in the Senedd, but externally as well with the public\u2014and given the fact there is a consultation, which I might encourage those campaigners from both sides of the argument to engage fully with when that is live, and, of course, the counterpetition which has quite quickly, I should say, got to around 6,000 signatures\u2014. I haven't got the figure right in front of me now, but it's around that figure, and still building. I think it is appropriate that we can keep this open and review it, perhaps later on this year, when either the counterpetition comes to committee or the consultation has been launched and closed. I should say I do echo the comments of Luke Fletcher and Buffy as well, and thank those people who helped with the inquiry. It was a useful discussion.Item 3.3, P-06-1323, 'We request that the Welsh Government purchase St David\u2019s Hall as a national resource for Wales'. This was submitted by Ben Herrington, with 3,575 signatures. I'll bring Members in to discuss this position and any actions they may wish to take. Rhys ab Owen.\n\nRhys ab Owen MS: Diolch yn fawr, Gadeirydd. I think we've discussed the Welsh Government's response on at least two occasions\u2014their unsurprising response that they weren't going to purchase St David's Hall, that the funding was not available, and, in any event, there would need to be a substantial five-year plan for them to be able to consider that. I'm not sure whether it would have been the answer for Welsh Government to buy it in any event, but I think that's the only way it could have come before this committee.I think we've postponed making a decision on two previous occasions to await the public consultation from Cardiff Council. I understand that the public consultation had responses from over 1,220 individuals, with the majority\u2014I think, 58 per cent\u2014supporting the council's proposals of having a long-term lease arrangement to manage St David's Hall with Live Nation. Now, obviously, I have major concerns about that, about such an important resource in our capital city being long leased in that way to Live Nation, especially considering the service that St David's Hall has provided to youth music and classical music.Chair, I'm looking to you and the clerking team now, as I'm unsure what more this committee can do, and whether the only option we have at the moment is to thank the petitioner for bringing forward this very important issue to our committee, but our committee's hands are tied at the moment, and that we have no choice but to close this petition. Diolch.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Rhys. Any further comments before I respond? No. Okay. I think you're right, Rhys, that this particular petition has probably reached the end of its journey, but, again, the feeling, obviously, of the public, with this petition itself and a similar petition on change.org, with over 21,000 signatures, clearly shows the strength of feeling. But, given the fact the public consultation from the council has ended that journey, and given the clear steer from the Welsh Government, I think we will have to agree to close this petition and thank the petitioner for using our platform as well. And, of course, I would encourage anyone looking to start a petition in Wales to consider using our platform as well. Any other further comments from Members, or just agreement? Okay.Item 3.4, P-06-1247, 'We call on the Welsh Government to lead the way by supporting trials of a four-day week in Wales'. This was submitted by Mark Hooper, with 1,619 signatures. I will declare an interest at this point; I know other Members will know Mark as well. I know Mark Hooper, the petitioner, myself. We did undertake an inquiry into this particular petition. There were differing views on the committee; I know the Conservative Member, Joel James, who's not here today, had a strong feeling of opposition towards this particular petition. But we did submit our report to the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government have responded to our recommendations. The Deputy Minister for Social Partnership has sent her response back, and in a letter to the committee she has stressed the importance of social partnership and the workforce partnership council, and it is where the Welsh Government will take the proposal to the workforce partnership council at its meeting on 29 March, to consider setting up a working group on a four-day week. And I think it was referenced in that letter by the Deputy Minister that no further decision from the Welsh Government will be taken until that workforce partnership council has either agreed to set up a working group, and, if so, conducted its work there.Given that fact, and given the fact there were differing opinions, not only in this committee, but I remember being one of the early listeners at six o'clock to a BBC Radio Wales phone-in session that had different opinions on this particular petition and the work we've done, can I suggest that perhaps we seek to debate our report in Senedd time and that we'll write to the Business Committee to suggest that? Are Members content with that? They are. Luke Fletcher wanted to come in.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just on the same level as you, I know Mark, so just to declare my interest on that side.But I do think that this is something we should now take to the floor of the Senedd and debate. I completely agree with your proposal, and I just want to take the opportunity to do a shameless plug as well. Next Tuesday, so 21 March, we'll be holding a panel session with Autonomy and 4 Day Week Global in the Senedd, so just an open invitation to those who might be interested who are watching to come along and engage with the panel.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Diolch yn fawr, Luke, for that. I'll certainly take an avid interest in that panel discussion, and I'm sure others will as well. Any comments from other Members? No. Okay. On that note, we'll seek to write to Business Committee and of course consider the petition again once we've had a response from them.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Item 4 on today's agenda: we now do conclude our public business of today. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42(ix), that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting, where we will discuss our future work programme, based on two inquiries that this committee is interested in? Are Members content? I can see that they are. Okay, thank you for that. Before I close, just to say that we will meet again on 27 March, and we will now go into private to discuss those items. Diolch yn fawr. Meeting closed.\n"}
{"question": "the Welsh Government is working to improve the provision of health services for the people of Cynon Valley EXCEPT?", "evidence": "  These programs offer the most up-to-date clinical advice and access to the latest best practices so that standards can be improved in all parts of Wales, including the Cynon Valley. ", "options": ["A. offer more medical support. ", "B. offer clinical advice.", "C. offer access to the latest best practices.", "D. improve the standards."], "answer": "A", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Vikki Howells.&nbsp;\n\nVikki Howells AM: 1. How is the Welsh Government working to improve the provision of health services for the people of Cynon Valley? OQ59213\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. A series of national programmes assist the health board in providing improved access to its services. These programmes offer the most up-to-date clinical advice and access to latest best practice so that standards can be improved in all parts of Wales, including the Cynon valley.\n\nVikki Howells AM: Thank you for your answer, First Minister, and I was really pleased to hear the announcement last month about the new diagnostics and treatment centre for south-east Wales, to be based in Rhondda Cynon Taf. This could not just reduce, but actually eliminate, backlogs in accessing treatment and substantially reduce waiting times, moving forward, for orthopedic surgeries in particular, for people in Cynon valley and neighbouring areas.&nbsp;Can you provide any information on timescales for delivery of this key project and, in addition, outline what help Welsh Government will be providing to health boards to get this new centre up and running?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Vikki Howells for that question, and for drawing attention to that very important development in the RCT area. And, Llywydd, it's a genuine example, I think, of the social partnership approach in Wales in action. The three buildings that are to be used were first identified by the local authority. They drew them to the attention of the health board. The health board had negotiations with the current private sector occupant of the buildings. The health board then involved itself in discussions with the wider south-east Wales health community, and the financial help to acquire the buildings was provided through the Welsh Government. So, there you have local government, the health service, the private sector and the Welsh Government all collectively involved in bringing about a development that, as Vikki Howells said, will lead to significant new capacity for residents in this part of Wales.&nbsp;In terms of timescales, it's important to remember that the building is still occupied by its current owner, but there will be a period over the next 12 months in which they bring their use of the building to an end, and diagnostic capacity, which will be the first phase of the new development, will be worked up by the health board, its partners, including the Welsh Government, and that will be the first phase in the next calendar year. And then, once that is developed, there will be physical space at the buildings to have dedicated elective capacity, with a particular focus on orthopaedic care, which will, as Vikki Howells said, Llywydd, make an important difference to patients in that part of Wales, in accelerating their access to treatment. And the Welsh Government will be there not just with the financial help we've offered so far, but, as I said in my original answer, by making sure that the health board has access to those national programmes, those national clinical leads, which will help to make sure that the most advantage can be derived from this new development.\n\nJoel James MS: First Minister, according to Stats Wales, in December 2022, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which covers the Cynon valley, along with Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and the rest of Rhondda Cynon Taf, had a staggering 13,732 patients waiting more than 14 weeks for diagnostic and therapy services, out of a population of 450,000. This represents 36 per cent of the total amount of people waiting more than 14 weeks in Wales. Cwm Taf health board also had 31,992 patients waiting over eight weeks, which represented 18 per cent of the Welsh total, which is, sadly, further evidence of the postcode lottery that exists in Wales with the health service.&nbsp;To put these figures into perspective, for the same month, the whole of London, which has a population of over nine million people, had a similar amount of 32,953 people waiting more than six weeks. Recent Office for National Statistics data shows that, out of the 331 areas in the United Kingdom, Merthyr Tydfil is officially the sickest place, with almost 10 per cent of the population in very bad health, whilst RCT is sixth and Bridgend is thirteenth. As you know, recent news shows that Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has now been put back into special measures, and the British Dental Association has warned that NHS dentistry in Wales could soon disappear, with the chairman of the BDA's Welsh general committee stating that Welsh NHS dentistry in its current state is unlikely to exist in a year or two's time. With this in mind, First Minister, what steps has the Welsh Government taken to improve on these appalling statistics? Thank you.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, it's being so cheerful that keeps him going, Llywydd\u2014it's certainly not the accuracy of his grasp of the facts. In some ways, the Member managed to answer his own question, eventually, by pointing to the fact that the reason why there are percentages of that sort waiting in Cwm Taf is because of the nature of the population it serves. It's not a postcode lottery at all; it's as the Member eventually managed to say\u2014it is because Cwm Taf Morgannwg serves one of the oldest and sickest populations that we see anywhere in Wales. And the demand for health services reflects the needs of that local population. It's all the better news, therefore, that the development that Vikki Howells pointed to will accelerate access not simply to diagnostic services, but to planned operations for people in that part of Wales.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: 2. What progress has the Welsh Government made on embedding prudent healthcare into every aspect of health and well-being in Cardiff Central? OQ59234\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Jenny Rathbone for that question. Llywydd, value-based healthcare continues to take forward the prudent healthcare principles of ill-health prevention, joint partnership with patients on the journey to improvement, and diversification of the workforce so that every practitioner operates at the top of their clinical licence.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: First Minister, I'm sure you will want to celebrate the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, mindful of the well-being of their staff, and inviting them to take part in courses on how to grow vegetables on the Llandough hospital site, obviously funded by the Cardiff and Vale health board charity\u2014something, I'm sure, close to both our hearts. But I also want to highlight their recent work on tackling the enduring epidemic of mental illness. Referrals to secondary care remain almost as high as they were during the pandemic. So, they've been training barbers to recognise signs of mental distress amongst their customers, and they're training people with lived experience of enduring mental health problems as tutors, to work alongside professional clinical tutors, involving individual patients and families and friends in a whole-system recovery, through something called the recovery college. How can this really creative response to the shortage of applicants to fill staff vacancies be deepened across Government, to help shrink the disparity in the numbers of years lived well between different socioeconomic groups, so harshly exposed by COVID? In Cardiff, it's 12 years.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Jenny Rathbone for that. I certainly share her enthusiasm for the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, at their Llandough site, in using the ground that they have available there for well-being initiatives. The fruit that is being grown in part of the western edge of that site offers patients as well as people who work for the health board an opportunity to be outside, in the fresh air, and with access to the things that we know improve individuals' sense of well-being.As far as the mental health impact of the pandemic is concerned, it continues to be seen in all parts of Wales. The Welsh Government's new investment in mental health is often very much concentrated in that prudent healthcare part of the spectrum: investment in tier 0 and tier 1 services, and the 111 'press 2' service that's available 24 hours every day in the Cardiff and Vale health board area, and with a publicity campaign, Llywydd, which will take place throughout this month, to increase patients' awareness and use of that very valuable service. I'm very struck by what the Member said, Llywydd, about the way in which it is possible to harness the efforts of people who aren't in the health service at all to be part of the work of identifying and attending to patients needs as early as possible when those needs arise. I do recall, some years ago now, when I was health Minister, visiting Pen-y-groes, a Welsh-speaking area in the Ammanford coalfield, to see a dementia service and being told by the GPs who ran it that their most important source of referrals were hairdressers on the main street of the village, because those hairdressers knew their clientele\u2014they could spot the person who wasn't quite managing as well as they used to, with the money, with the organisation, and they would make an early referral into the dementia service, so that people could get that preventative intervention that is possible when you manage to identify people early on that journey. The barbers in Cardiff, the postal workers in Cardiff, who we know have those day in, day out interactions on the doorstep, all these are people who we can make helpful to the health service in that prudent healthcare way.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, last week, my colleague Janet Finch-Saunders, along with other MSs, hosted a meeting about the cladding situation here in Wales, and the Welsh Cladiators, who have been pioneering the lobbying work and the projection of the plight of many home owners here in Wales who are caught up in this, really should be commended by all Members in this Chamber. One of the asks among many was why isn't the Welsh Government coming forward and adopting the legislation that has been put down in England, to take sections 116 and 125, to give rights to leaseholders so that they themselves can exercise those rights in holding the developers to account. I've heard Mike Hedges, one of your backbenchers, speak in favour of this in the Chamber when speaking to the leader of the house. There's cross-party support for this. We had a debate prior to Christmas. Will the Government reconsider its view, in light of the ongoing crisis that many home owners here in Wales face?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, first of all, I join with the leader of the opposition in congratulating those people who continue to campaign on this issue to make sure that the Welsh Government is always aware of developments that they are in touch with and that their views are conveyed to us. And I know that last week's meeting was an opportunity for that to happen, and the Minister will be following that up in her forthcoming meeting with the strategic safety stakeholder group, where these matters can be further debated, and the Minister keeps all those arguments about sections 118 to section 125 under review.The position, though, is that those regulations\u2014those sections\u2014were specifically written for the building safety regime in England. It is not as simple as simply picking them up and dropping them into the very different Welsh context. And there are some disadvantages for leaseholders who find themselves within that regime, because here in Wales our intention is that leaseholders should not be required to pay for the remedial action that is required to their buildings, whereas those sections expose leaseholders to bills up to \u00a310,000, and we don't intend to do that in Wales. So, while we will continue to keep the position under close review, we're not convinced that a simple drag-and-drop of those sections into the Welsh context would deliver what the campaigners say it would deliver, and we're not convinced that it could not actually act to their detriment.&nbsp;\n\n"}

I'd like to welcome the Minister for Health and Social Services this morning and her officials. So, perhaps, if I ask officials to introduce themselves for the public record.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMari Williams: Mari Williams, Welsh Government legal services health team.&nbsp;\n\nLeanne Roberts: Morning. I'm Leanne Roberts. I'm the policy lead for healthcare procurement reform.&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Eluned Morgan, health and social services Minister for Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nDafydd Evans: Dafydd Evans, senior responsible officer for the Bill.&nbsp;\n\nNick Lambert: Nick Lambert, Welsh Government legal services, Treasury team.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you very much. Welcome back to some of the panel, who were with us for a technical briefing. We appreciate that, Minister. That was very helpful in our early discussions of the scrutiny process. So, thank you for that. Perhaps I'll ask the Minister: what does the Government want to achieve from this Bill? What's the Government seeking to achieve?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: In order to answer that, if you don't mind, I'll just give a little bit of a background to how we came here, because it is a little bit complicated, and this is not the most exciting Bill you will have had in front of you as a committee. So, what happened is, after we left the European Union, the UK Government said, 'Look, we'll do things differently when it comes to procurement.' And the health team in the UK Government said, 'Oh, well, you know what? We might want to carve ourselves out of whatever you're going to do with the rest of the economy. We want something specific for health, and we want to do things differently for health.' And, as it happens, there was the Health and Care Act 2022 that was going through Parliament. They, therefore, effectively, have written something so that they can have a separate selection regime, so a separate procurement approach from the rest of the economy.Now, because health is devolved, that was effectively an English-only Bill, so they just cracked on with that and didn't actually think about the implications for us, and obviously we live cheek by jowl with the English NHS. They have a huge market, we have 3 million people that we have to service. So, suddenly, we're in a situation where we're going to find ourselves in a different procurement place from England, and there are potential implications for that. So, what we're doing here is we're plugging a gap that has been created by some of the actions that have happened in England, and allowing us the opportunity, should we wish, to align ourselves to the new health procurement regime in England. Now, the problem is they're still going through that process at the moment, so we're not quite sure where it's going to land, in terms of what's going to be covered, but what we want through this Bill is the opportunity and the ability to be able to align, should we wish to do so. I hope that's given a little bit of a background, because it's quite technical, but that's a little bit of the background.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Can I come in straight away, just with a little supplementary? You said that you want to give yourselves an opportunity, as a Government, to align with changes in England. Do you see it exclusively in that way? Or do you see this also as an opportunity to differentiate yourself and head in a different direction, if you so wish, if you're not happy with what you're seeing developing in England?&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, that's an opportunity as well. We're going to have to see what they do and whether we want to follow that. At the moment, we don't know what they're going to put in, so what we didn't want to do was just say, 'Chuck us in that Bill', because we don't know what they're going to come up with. But this will give us the opportunity to follow or not follow, as we see fit.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Okay, thank you.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: What do you see, Minister, as\u2014? What's your vision, I suppose, for health procurement in Wales?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think what's important is to understand that procurement in itself is not what we're about. We're about delivering our vision, which has been set out in 'A Healthier Wales', and what we need in terms of procurement is a system that will enable us to deliver the vision that we've got. What we have been advocating for a while is, perhaps, more collaborative working, making sure we've got high-quality services that are delivered efficiently, that are focused on patient outcomes, but making sure we also have the right checks and balances, which ensures that we spend the little money that we have efficiently on services.\n\nRussell George AM: Quite rightfully, Minister, you talk about patient outcomes, and you said earlier this isn't the most exciting Bill, as well. What would be your advice if I was to get back home this afternoon and a constituent said to me, 'What have you been doing?' I'd say, 'Well, I've been scrutinising this Bill.' How would you explain to your constituent, for example, how this Bill is going to make the health service better for them or the outcomes better for them?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I guess until we see the regulations, it's difficult to say, so let's remember this is what they call a framework Bill. It gives us a holding place where we can then make regulations underneath that, so it gives us the authority and the ability to make rules in future\u2014\n\nRussell George AM: Can you give us an example, perhaps?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Okay. I think what's clear is that there are examples of where there may be barriers to entry for, perhaps, smaller providers, because the procurement rules at the moment could be quite onerous, could be quite high in terms of administrative need. What this will give us an opportunity to do, for example\u2014at the moment, the default position is that everything's got to go through procurement\u2014what this will do for us in future is allow us, for example, the opportunity to roll over contracts that exist already. If they're being well serviced, if we're getting efficiency from the system, we could roll over those contracts. So, that's one thing. It's very difficult to do that now; we have to go through the whole onerous activity. And if, for example, we could see that there was only the possibility of one tender coming up, then we could, perhaps, look at a direct contract being awarded. And then, of course, competition is the third factor. But, at the moment, it's just assumed everything goes out to competition. So, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in future that should save, or could potentially save on some administrative work. I don't know if Dafydd would like to expand on that.\n\nDafydd Evans: Thank you, Minister. We've heard from a number of places that there are things that would want to be looked at through the regulations, so, exploring some of the things. But, currently, because of the way that procurement is done, and it's quite formal through that tendering\u2014. People have talked to us about wanting to explore things like clusters, so where a health board may work with GPs and others in the third sector to come together to collaboratively put that best service together, perhaps, for communities. So, by having a process that is more collaborative, as the Minister's described, rather than it starting with formal procurement, there may be examples there where you could look at services slightly differently and bring a collaboration together to give those better services. So, those are the things we'd want to explore, I think, through the regulations and through consultation. But a Bill that is competition last, which is what this is, a provider selector regime, rather than competition first, which is what the default the Minister has described is, gives you that opportunity. We won't be able to explore those as well without.&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think the other thing is the third sector. There are real opportunities for the third sector here, as well. That's something I'm particularly interested in.\n\nRussell George AM: I think what Dafydd has outlined, and yourself, is what we've heard ourselves in the earlier evidence sessions. So, certainly, we've had that view from some stakeholders that it's a complex landscape at the moment in terms of commissioning. Minister, are you happy, and your officials as well, with the level of engagement that you've had with the UK Government?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think it's fair to say that in the early days it wasn't great. They were just cracking on with this Health and Care Act and the provider selector regime development, and hadn't really thought about the impact it would have on us. So, after I wrote to the Minister, we have had better engagement. We have seen, for example, an early draft of their regulations, but we haven't got the final draft yet, so what I am hoping\u2014. Things have definitely improved and they've agreed to liaise with our officials on cross-border arrangements as part of developing their guidelines. So, it's certainly improved, but it wasn't great at the beginning, I think it's fair to say.\n\nRussell George AM: Have you had any opportunity at all to feed into the UK Government's policy development in regard to the PSR?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Not really, and not early on. I think it's just kind of having a look at what's coming our way, because obviously, we don't have to follow everything that they're doing; health is devolved. So, once we know what they're doing, we can make a judgment then as to whether we want to follow it or not.\n\nRussell George AM: Okay. Thank you. Jack.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thanks, Chair. Good morning, Minister. We've heard the same from officials and other evidence sessions that we hold. I'm just trying to gauge the risk of absolutely not doing this and how real that risk is.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, I think, what we've had as a response from the people we've consulted with, so the people who commission, is a very clear, 'We want to align', okay? So, that's the line they've heard from us. So, there may be examples\u2014. So, at the moment, for example, if you look at some very complex mental health support, we currently commission some of that from England, and what we don't want is a situation where those organisations in England that are providing a service to us now, for what is quite a small market\u2014because you can imagine, we're not talking about a lot of people\u2014they might just say, 'That's a completely different procurement regime. We're not playing; it's just too much trouble for us.' So, that's the danger is that we lose some of those services that exist at the moment. That's one of the dangers, anyway.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: That's a good example as well.\n\nRussell George AM: Gareth and then Rhun. Gareth.\n\nGareth Davies MS: Thanks, Chair. I just want to ask on maybe a technical level; we see a lot of LCMs going through the Senedd that are replications of or passages of UK legislation that comes to the Senedd, so, in that sense, if we're taking a lot of the elements of the Health and Care Act from the UK, why was that not an LCM, and why is it a procurement Bill? Is that the will of UK Ministers to have something different in Wales, or is that the will of the Welsh Government to say, 'We want to take different elements and make our own Bill', as a consequence of the Health and Care Act going through the UK? I appreciate it's quite a layman's question, but just on a technical level, I'd just like to know.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, had we gone down the LCM route and asked them to put us under the Health and Care Act, then we wouldn't have had any possibility of diverging from whatever they're going to come up with. And at the moment, what we're talking about is a framework Bill and the interesting bit of this legislation will come when we're looking at the regulations. So, what is it that's captured in the regulations? And until we see that, it's difficult for us to assess whether we want to align or not. So, we need the flexibility through this very short Bill that we're bringing through here to allow us to either copy or to say, 'Well, we'll take most of it, but there may be some areas where we don't want to play the same way you're playing in England.' So, that's why we didn't go down the LCM route.\n\nRussell George AM: Rhun.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: I want to go back to the response to Jack's question. I understand in principle why officials would be afraid that service providers could decide that they don't want to provide services to Wales again. That would raise concerns about losing services. But to what extent have you been able to prove that that would happen, by speaking to providers who say, 'Do you know what? We don't foresee that we would want to be part of a health regime in Wales if there was a different procurement regime'?&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Dafydd, do you want to come in here?\n\nDafydd Evans: So, most of the conversations we've had in the informal engagement so far have been with the NHS and specifically with the people in the NHS who manage all of the procurement and all of these relationships with the providers. So, I think it's their operational advice in the way that they currently manage these that\u2014. They know that there are already tensions sometimes in being able to get services even under the current level playing field, because, as the Minister said, we're a small\u2014we're sometimes a small market. So, we had a very clear message from the procurement experts in the NHS that, if you change the level of the playing field again\u2014. There were some services, which we talked about last time\u2014renal services, mental health services\u2014where they're saying there's a very real risk of this.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: It would be very useful to us as a committee if we were able to have this\u2014even if it's unattributed, even if it's fairly confidential\u2014so that we can understand better those actual concerns that arise from actual contracts that are currently held between the NHS and providers, if that might be available.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I guess it's their information to give, so\u2014\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Indeed.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: \u2014we'll have to ask them whether they\u2014. But you could ask them that directly, couldn't you, as a committee?&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: We'll do that.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Our hope is that you already have it, that you could pass it on.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes, I mean that's part of the consultation\u2014that's what has been fed back to us.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. That's a good suggestion. Jenny, I want to come to you, but then do you want to come on to your set of questions after you ask your supplementary?\n\n"}

The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine.\n ", "options": ["As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. "], "answer": "C", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Alun Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAlun Davies AM: 1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the resettlement of people from Ukraine in Wales? OQ59465\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for that question. As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. We continue to support guests, helping them to move on to longer term accommodation, where they can live more settled lives and be supported within local communities.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I'm grateful to the First Minister for that. This afternoon, I think we should also pay tribute to the work of Mick Antoniw, who has united Members across the Chamber in his support for the people of Ukraine over the last period. And the Welsh Government has also, I think, First Minister, demonstrated a real commitment to the people of that country. It has both condemned Putin's illegal invasion, the barbaric war crimes that have been committed against the Ukrainian people, and it has also reached out its hand of friendship to those Ukrainians who are seeking to escape the consequences of Putin's war.&nbsp;In Blaenau Gwent, First Minister, over 130 people have initially been resettled in the county borough. We're also looking at how we can ensure that there is additional support for those people who are seeking to make their homes again in Blaenau Gwent. The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine. Will the First Minister assure me this afternoon that the Welsh Government will continue this support for the people of Ukraine, as we continue to support the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Putin's invasion?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for what he has said about the success of the programme here in Wales. I'm sure Members would want me to recognise as well the part that he has played in making sure that goods from Wales reach families in Ukraine, where war crimes continue to be committed right up to today. I thank the local Member for Blaenau Gwent for what he has said about the success of the scheme in that county borough. It has been a genuinely outstanding success. Workers in Blaenau Gwent local authority's support team have done an outstanding job in helping people from Ukraine, who came first of all to the welcome centre, to be able to move on to longer term accommodation, whether that is within Blaenau Gwent itself, which has welcomed many Ukrainian citizens into that move-on accommodation, or whether it's work with neighbouring local authorities. Indeed, Llywydd, so successful has the Blaenau Gwent team become that we have asked them to take a national lead in assisting other local authorities in that move-on effort, bringing the expertise that they have developed, the operational skills that they have, to support others to do a similar job. And, of course, the Welsh Government, with the \u00a340 million that we have set aside in our budget for the current financial year to continue to welcome people from Ukraine, forced to flee from their own country, looking for an opportunity to re-establish their lives, will go on working with all our partners to make sure that we offer that hand of friendship, live up to our reputation for being a nation of sanctuary, and do everything we can to help people to re-establish their lives here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: In February, Welsh media reported, and I quote, that,'Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward.'And although the Welsh Government stated it was working closely with local councils to get Ukrainian refugees into longer term accommodation, refugees claimed only one in 100 landlords will take a Ukrainian. And, in March, the British Red Cross warned that better infrastructure is needed to support Ukrainians to rebuild their lives in Wales, and that the Welsh Government should work with the UK Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to establish schemes to help Ukrainians into private rented properties by meeting the upfront costs and acting as guarantors where needed. I know the Welsh Government's still awaiting clarification on the \u00a3150 million resettlement funding from UK Government, but what specific action has your Government taken since then to address these findings? And what figures does the Welsh Government have regarding the number of Ukrainians affected and what has happened to them since?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation. Despite the anxieties that were expressed, indeed, over 1,700 Ukrainian guests have already been moved in Wales on to longer term accommodation. And, in terms of the specific actions that have been taken, of the \u00a340 million that I mentioned a moment ago, Llywydd, \u00a34 million of that is specifically to assist our local authority partners in securing additional move-on accommodation, and that does, indeed, cover some of the points that Mark Isherwood made about assisting people who are able to secure somewhere in private accommodation with some of the upfront costs that you face when you're trying to secure places in the private rented sector. At the same time, we have a major transitional accommodation capital programme mobilised through the Welsh Government: over \u00a376 million used last year to assist local authorities and social landlords to deliver more homes to support all those people who are in housing need. That funding has already delivered nearly 1,000 additional homes, and many people from Ukraine have been able to take advantage of that programme. So, we continue to work closely with our partners, Llywydd. Nobody is suggesting that it is easy to find move-on accommodation in what is already a competitive accommodation market, but I think the success story here in Wales is one that would bear up to scrutiny from anyone.&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: 2. What is the Welsh Government doing to ensure that school leavers have the necessary skills to succeed in the employment market? OQ59496\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Careers and work-related experiences are mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales, and Careers Wales provides support for all schools across Wales to build relationships with employers. Qualifications reform and our employability programmes will prepare young people for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: I'm grateful to you, First Minister, for the answer. I ask the question today in the context of equipping our young people with the skills they need to compete in an increasingly globalised world. And, to that end, it's no coincidence that the countries that produce the best outcomes in terms of maths attainment are often also the countries that have emerging and innovative global economies. And in the UK, I think, sometimes, some of us have a tendency to write off the importance of mathematics. People often joke about not being able to do maths, but that's something we'd never say about reading, for example, so that's something I'm glad that the Prime Minister has correctly identified as a problem that makes us less competitive internationally. And he suggested that further maths learning may be required later on in a young person's education to address the problem. Obviously, there are no one-size-fits-all answers here, First Minister, but, given education is devolved in Wales, and, according to the latest Programme for International Student Assessment results, maths attainment in Wales was the worst of the UK nations, what consideration have you given to what the Welsh Government can do to help turn this situation around and to ensure that school leavers have the maths skills that they need so they can reach their full potential? &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I agree with Tom Giffard about the importance of mathematics. Much of what we do in Wales is to equip young people for the digital skills that they will need for the future in which that aspect of the employment market will become more and more important. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions don't match the rhetoric that we hear from him. He was responsible for the catastrophic Multiply programme when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014\u00a3100 million top-sliced out of money that was meant to come to Wales for a national programme that, I'm afraid, has been a huge failure on the ground. Certainly it has not delivered what was promised here in Wales. I'm afraid the Multiply programme just demonstrates the difficulties when Ministers in Whitehall believe that they are able to design things on the ground in parts of the United Kingdom where they have no reach at all. They designed their Multiply programme without a single word of discussion with the Welsh Government or with the local authorities that are expected to deliver it. As a result, it has not been possible to spend the money that was allocated to Wales. That money is yet to be released to local authorities so that they can do useful things with it, including\u2014and I agree with the importance of the point\u2014to improve numeracy amongst people who are leaving school and people in the workplace who are looking to improve their numeracy skills. So, while I agree on the basic proposition, I cannot agree that the way the UK Government has gone about this has demonstrated a success. In fact, I'm afraid, it is exactly the opposite.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Prif Weinidog, Welsh pupils and young people have such a vast array of skills and talents. In terms of future employment, it benefits everyone for there to be a system in place that allows them to access educational opportunities that actually utilise and play to their own strengths, while ensuring they have the skills for jobs. I know the Welsh Government understands this, so, on that note, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the junior apprenticeship programme pilot, and will we see more pupils across Wales be enabled to access such positive opportunities?\n\n"}

"], "answer": "A", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: So, I'd very much like to welcome Sarah Germain, who is the chief executive officer of FareShare, as well as Jen Griffiths, the service manager for Flintshire County Council, and Robbie Davison, in charge of Well Fed. So, welcome to all of you.In light of the fact the Trussell Trust isn't here with us today, I did notice in its evidence that there had been a sort of drop-off in the demand for food, marginally, in the month of July, when there was a cost-of-living payment made by the UK Government, but that it was then back up to really high levels again in August. I just wondered if you could, very briefly, just summarise what the current situation is, given that we have got your written evidence in all cases. Just how difficult is it for organisations that are endeavouring to ensure that everybody is eating and heating?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: I can start, if you like. So, the demand just isn't going away. It's going up, if anything. As an organisation ourselves that supports other organisations, we are finding that we are getting more and more requests for support. In addition, the organisations that we are working with are also asking for more food. So, the organisations that we are already working with are asking for more food, and we are always having more organisations asking us for food as well.FareShare UK did a survey back in September-October time, and it found that 96 per cent of our community food members in south Wales were saying that they had had an increase in demand since January the previous year. So, that shows that almost every organisation that we are working with has seen that increase in demand.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, are people actually being turned away?\n\nSarah Germain: I don't know if people are being turned away. I know that we, and they, are finding it difficult to meet the demand that is there, and that demand is growing constantly.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Who are the main people who are using these services? We know, obviously, that anybody with children, anybody with a disability, and also private renters whose housing benefit isn't covering the cost of their rent, are in a desperate situation. Is that a reasonable summary of who you are seeing?\n\nSarah Germain: I think that it's across the board. There are all sorts of organisations. We work with all sorts of organisations. We work with everyone from homeless hostels, women's refuges, through to pantries and community kitchens. So, we work with a whole host of organisations, and I think that demand is going up across the board. But the highest levels of demand are within groups\u2014. The highest demand groups are families with children, older people and lone parents. Those are the three highest groups that our community groups are saying that that they've seen an increase in demand from.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Robbie Davison or Jen Griffiths.\n\nRobbie Davison: I'd just add that there's a kind of new poverty going on. I don't know if I put in the evidence that we've submitted that we are noticing about a 20 per cent increase in people wanting good food services. What's been interesting, and almost alarming at the same time, is that there are people now coming through the system who have never been in need of food aid or, if you like, poverty services at all. Therefore, they don't know what to do while they are in them. So, for the first time, they are trying to make do with maybe visits to a food bank, maybe visits to a pantry, maybe relying on services like us. But, because it's the first time that they have been involved, they've needed to get involved in services like ours and others. The issue for them, when you're talking to them and you're meeting them for the first time, is that there's a panic\u2014there's a real panic\u2014that they don't know what to do next because they've never been in the situation before. That's coming through now.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, thank you. Jen Griffiths.&nbsp;\n\nJen Griffiths: Thank you. Flintshire is fairly rural. We've got lots of communities that don't have access to the main town centres\u2014we've got five county towns in Flintshire. And what we are noticing, as Robbie's just said, it's people who've never accessed the system. So, we've got support hubs where we offer advice and guidance, but people are coming in who won't access the benefits system because they wouldn't qualify and they don't meet those criteria. However, they're really struggling to pay their bills. It's eat or heat, feed your children or feed yourself, and it's almost like there's a squeezed middle who are missed by the benefits system because they simply wouldn't qualify. However, because of the cost of living, they're just really struggling to cope, and it's certainly something we've seen through our hub models in Flintshire. People we've never bumped into before are accessing services and trying to find ways to alleviate their situation.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Given that there is clearly so much need, how are organisations managing to meet that need? Sarah, you said that you weren't aware of anybody being turned away, but if the public doesn't support your organisations, then the situation could become a whole lot worse, couldn't it?\n\nSarah Germain: Yes, I think they are feeling it\u2014the organisations that are supporting people that are in this situation are starting to feel it themselves. They stepped up to the plate during the pandemic, they've been working really hard all the way through the pandemic to help through that, and then straight off the back of that we're into this cost-of-living crisis. So, I think the organisations are finding it hard. They are feeling that demand. I've got some stats somewhere if I can just find them. They're being hit by the cost-of-living crisis themselves as well, because obviously their bills are going up, the cost of food is going up, wages are starting to go up as well, so the organisations themselves are starting to feel the impact of this as an organisation as well.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Robbie.\n\nRobbie Davison: It's interesting, because the pressure on, if you like, the third sector is continuing to grow and increase, and it's important to note that. What we've been attempting to do as an organisation is\u2014. We have got a completely different model. We've got a commercial model running alongside a social model, and we are trying desperately to move people away from charity alone and to get them to be contributors to their own well-being. And by that I mean we offer four weeks' worth of support that is free to access, which is meals for a week, but after four weeks we start to charge. But we start to charge at a subsidised rate. So, for four weeks, we charge \u00a310 and people get \u00a340 worth of food, and then for the following four weeks\u2014so, it's 12 weeks in total\u2014they pay \u00a315. The reason this is important is because we are using our profits to subsidise the food, but what we are actually asking people to do is to take part in looking after themselves, moving them away from an over-reliance on charity and getting them back into thinking about their own well-being, at a cost that they can afford. Really, really important\u2014good food has to be affordable, otherwise good food will just not be on offer to people.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Sioned Williams wanted to follow up on one of your comments. Sioned.\n\nSioned Williams MS: Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to follow up on a comment made by Sarah from FareShare regarding the increase in demand. In the written evidence, 75 institutions on the waiting list and 42 organisations\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014in specific areas of Wales\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\n\nSarah Germain: Those groups are primarily in south-east Wales, because that's where the majority of our members are. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Sorry.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Sorry, Sarah. We just have to take a halt for a moment because we've lost Sioned. Are you able to hear what Sarah Germain's starting to say?&nbsp;\n\nSioned Williams MS: Yes, I can hear.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Excellent. We lost you momentarily. Sarah, please do continue.&nbsp;\n\nJane Dodds MS: Chair, sorry. Could I just raise a point, which is that I'm having a problem hearing Rob's microphone? I'm not sure if anybody else is having a problem with that microphone.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Well, I think the technicians can raise the volume on that mike.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: There is a red light here and it's just gone\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: No, don't touch\u2014\n\nRobbie Davison: I won't touch it.\n\nSarah Germain: I think that means you're on.&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Okay.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Can you hear Robbie now, Jane?&nbsp;\n\nRobbie Davison: Can you hear me? Great.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay, that's fine. Sarah, back to you.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Germain: Yes. So, those 75 organisations are across south-east Wales, because that's the majority of where we are.

{"question": "Why does Dr. Victoria Jenkins believe it's important to balance discretion and accountability in environmental law?", "evidence": "  i.

To ensure flexibility while maintaining government accountability", "D. To ensure flexibility while maintaining government accountability"], "answer": "C", "content": "Llyr Gruffydd AM: We move on to the second item where, of course, we're holding our first evidence session relating to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill as part of Stage 1 scrutiny of the Bill. You'll remember that we received evidence from the Minister at the end of the spring term, and we will be hearing from her again at the end of this first stage. But, before us today we have two academics who I'm sure are going to contribute to the scrutiny work, and therefore I welcome Dr Victoria Jenkins, associate professor in law with Swansea University, and Professor Enda Hayes, who is a professor of air quality and carbon management in the University of the West of England. A very warm welcome to you both and thank you for joining us. We'll go straight to questions, and I know that Janet Finch-Saunders wants to ask the first question. Thank you.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, bore da. Is the Bill, as currently drafted, sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in air quality in Wales and soundscapes? And if not, why not?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: Do you want&nbsp;to go first?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: A nice easy question to start. So, air quality and the challenge of dealing with air quality is not new. Since the Environment Act 1995, which is 25 years ago, we've been trying to address this challenge and, to be very honest, we have fundamentally failed. We're very good at diagnosing the problem; we're just not very good at solving it. Now, there are elements of this Bill that I think are going to have a fundamental effect, a positive effect on that challenge. Part of the issues around the Environment Act was the wording of the Act\u2014that you had to work in 'pursuit' of the air quality objectives. We now have got stronger language saying that we have to 'secure' them. So, that's good. Updating of the strategy on a more regular basis, evidence-based targets I think are all really, really positive steps. The bit that worries me is I get a tone from the Bill that we're almost starting from scratch, and we're not. We've got 25-30 years of evidence behind us, which means, I think, we can be a lot more ambitious in terms of the timelines, the targets and how we are going to get there. So, it's Marmite for me at the moment, because there are some bits that I think are really, really good and will solve a lot of the issues and will help us progress in terms of addressing the problems, but it just feels like we can do more.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And we'll come on to some of those individual issues, I'm sure. Dr Jenkins.\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: My interest in this Bill is in relation to how we balance, and my interest generally in terms of environmental law is how we create that balance between giving policy makers and giving Government the discretion to take action to achieve something, but at the same time ensuring accountability. So, that's where I think law may have done us a disservice in the past, and that, moving forward, we need more innovative approaches in that respect. And, from that perspective, I think there are, again, some good bits of this Bill, which are really attempting to put into place a robust framework. I should say I've been an environmental academic lawyer for over 20 years, but I don't specialise in air quality law specifically, so I'm less familiar with the science, but that's why Professor Hayes is here. So, I would say it makes it a little bit trickier for me to talk about the ambition of the Bill in those circumstances, but I'm here to discuss the framework and how it sits today in terms of that balance between discretionary powers and accountability.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Excellent. We will indeed be pursuing some of those points, as well, in a moment, but I'll come to Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I want to go through a specific point right at the outset, which is the scope of the Bill. You touched on the point about starting from scratch. Well, actually, we have various policies in place. One of them is the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013. I declared my interest earlier on there. Now, the active travel group have submitted evidence to this about whether we need to finish some unfinished business that could have been done at the time of the original active travel Act. It's to do with things such as duties to promote active travel, which we've failed to do, et cetera. Now, within the Bill, the Bill addresses two specific, distinct purposes\u2014and my thanks for the briefing note on this\u2014improving air quality, and assessing and managing noise. The cross-party group submission makes the point that Welsh Government state that, in their clean air plan, transport is now the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, predominantly due to emissions from road transport, accounting for approximately one third of emissions, and also, within the explanatory memorandum to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill, it states that our 27 noise maps suggest the homes of more than 200,000 people across Wales are exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organization's 2009 night-noise guidelines, and make the point that the most significant way to deal with this is shifting people away from road use, motorised vehicles, into active travel, walking and cycling, and they suggest some amendments. Have you had time to look at that? Sorry for the extensive preamble, but have you had time to look at that, to express an opinion as to whether you think amendments on active travel would fall within the scope of this Bill? And if you haven't\u2014and I realise you may not\u2014would you be able to go away and have a look at this to see whether you think that those may fall within the scope, because the Llywydd will ultimately have to make a decision on this?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I haven't had a chance to look at it before coming today. I do think that the active travel legislation is significant in the context of air quality and public health, and from my perspective, as an environmental lawyer as well, it's particularly important in bringing together our objectives in Wales in relation to both public health and environmental protection. So, it's certainly, from that perspective, something that I would consider important.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I haven't had a chance to look at it either, but what I would say is that when you're looking at solutions, particularly for transport, active travel is essential. You've got to get to that point. I think, for years, we've been very much orientated in our solutions towards technocentric solutions. So, these are cleaner vehicles, cleaner fuels. That will only get us so far; the scale of the problem here means that we have to look at behavioural interventions, which means getting more people out of vehicles, onto bikes, and out of cars. That's a given. There are a lot of things you have to address to get around that: affordability, accessibility, reliability\u2014all those things that come with public transport\u2014and safety issues around active travel infrastructure, things like that. It's essential. If we're going to solve this problem, then we've got to deal with it.The other point that I might add, if I may, is that what we're dealing with here is a public health issue. It's a public health issue. So, if you're looking at active travel interventions, those interventions will have the core benefits of also working towards better public health. So, it isn't just about improving air quality; it's also the benefits you get elsewhere. So, it's essential, in my mind.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Rather than delay the committee, then, Chair\u2014and thank you for those answers; so, in principle, you've got no objection and, in fact, you can see the benefits of it\u2014I wonder if I could, perhaps, be cheeky enough to ask you to go away and look at it, perhaps discuss it with colleagues in law and whatever to see whether you think it falls within the scope of the two aims of this Bill.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: Okay.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Janet, did you want to come back in on something? And then we'll come back to Huw.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Thank you, Chair. All it was, when we take evidence during the forming of new Bills, quite often, one thing that comes up is that we haven't collected enough data. Now, you say that we look like we're almost at the start again, but a lot of years have gone before. Has the Welsh Government been proactive in collecting the relevant data so that any Bill going forward will be based on really good evidence, if you like?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I can start there. You can always get more data, is the short answer. You can always have more, it can always be better. Across Wales, if we're looking at air quality monitoring data, we've got a pretty extensive network of monitoring sites. I think, from memory, there are about fortyish continuous analysers run by local authorities, and about 10 to 12 analysers connected to the automatic urban and rural network. There's plenty of data already out there. Now, that can always be improved, and I think the tone of the Bill means that we'll have to think differently about how we monitor. So, at the moment, we've monitored for compliance, we've monitored where we've got problematic areas, where we've got these hotspots, where we've got these risks of exceedances. This Bill, again, seems to be more orientated towards prevention, being more proactive\u2014again, the public health side of the issue\u2014which means we have to think differently about how we monitor in terms of understanding public health, and bringing that air quality, health, deprivation triple jeopardy into the equation. So, we've got plenty to start from; we can always have more, and we will have to think differently because the Bill is orientating our approach slightly differently.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Fine.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Let me come on, then, to ask for your views on the Welsh Government's decision, as it stands, to set air quality targets in regulations rather than on the face of the Bill. And their argument is that this will give greater flexibility to respond to the latest guidance and to futureproof the Bill. Do you have sympathy with that or would you prefer to see air quality targets bang on the face of the Bill?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I think this is a question for me in the sense that, if you say too much on the face of primary legislation like this, then you are impinging your discretion to take action as things proceed and as scientific knowledge and understanding moves on. So, it is often a good idea to create a power to introduce regulations. That said, the issue then becomes, well, to what extent do you give the Government discretion, or the Executive discretion, to bring in those regulations and what's the framework for that. So, currently, there is quite a lot of discretion now given to the Executive in that respect, and that's something that you might want to consider further.\n\n"}

What plans does the Welsh Government have in place to help the young people of Arfon with the costs of traveling on public transport? OQ59096\n\nLee Waters AM: Diolch. One of the aims of 'Llwybr Newydd', the Wales transport strategy, is to reduce the cost of sustainable travel for everyone in Wales, including young people. We are working towards an accessible transport system across the nation and have a number of initiatives aimed at younger travellers.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: It's good to hear that there are plans in the pipeline, and, of course, we need to extend them and to bring new plans forward too.

There's a lack of bus services in the first instance, with some communities without a way to travel at all at times, because there are no trains, metro, appropriate cycling routes, nor are there bus services at some times of the day. Now, Yr Orsaf in Penygroes is developing a project to support residents, including young people, who face barriers because of a lack of public transport in dyffryn Nantlle, with the support of the dyffryn Nantlle community transport partnership. Is community transport an area that you as a Deputy Minister want to see developing in the future, and, if this is a priority for you, how much funding has been earmarked for encouraging this kind of transport in the Government's draft budget for the next financial year?\n\nLee Waters AM: Thank you. A number of points there. I'm familiar with the work of Partneriaeth Ogwen and have visited some of their schemes\u2014they're an outstanding organisation. I was particularly struck by the scheme we've been funding them for to retrofit bicycles, to add a battery to them, which, particularly in rural areas, particularly hilly areas, is a really practical thing that we can do to help people who don't have easy access to a car or to public transport. We know that, for generations, we've been favouring investment into road schemes, for those people who have cars, and, over time, have been neglecting public transport, and we've seen usage decline, we've seen routes shrink and we've seen fares go up. So, that is one of the reasons why we're bringing forward our bus Bill, to redesign the service, and it's one of the reasons why we'll be publishing the roads review next Tuesday, to, over time, shift resource from car-based schemes to schemes for everyone.In the meantime, we do have some really difficult financial challenges, and we are seeing bus schemes being withdrawn, which illustrates the problem we have with the privatised system, because there is no strategic overview to this\u2014it's being done randomly by bus companies. And then, we have the further problem, particularly in rural Wales, where bus companies are struggling to keep their business model going, and the cost of energy is really stopping them being able to run routes, and they're not tendering for fresh services. So, we have a range of challenges facing us, but the fundamental problem is the lack of investment that we have. Because we have prioritised other things, including as part of the co-operation agreement. We could have chosen to prioritise public transport; we chose other things, and we have to do the best we can with what we've got. But, clearly, as part of our modal shift and the net-zero targets, we need to shift resource far more into public transport.\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I just want to echo the comments raised by the Member for Arfon, and recognise that this important focus is required on public transport, especially for rural areas, in areas like Arfon and across north Wales\u2014the region I represent, of course. Deputy Minister, I'm sure you are an avid reader of the Welsh Conservative manifesto, especially the one for the 2021 Senedd elections. In that, we as Conservatives called for free bus travel and discounted rail travel for 16 to 24-year-olds, to help our young people access education, training and employment. This of course could embed that modal shift that you and I are so keen to see, whilst also supporting our environment, so importantly. So, in light of this, Minister, what consideration have you and the Welsh Government given to this type of idea, to see that free access to buses for our young people, so we can see that modal shift whilst also supporting our environment? Thank you very much.\n\nLee Waters AM: Well, there's no doubt that, if we had lower prices, we'd have higher use. There are schemes right across the world, including free bus use in Normandy and elsewhere, and free bus schemes in Wales, in Cardiff and Swansea and Newport, for short periods, which have shown an uptake in usage. So, we know that, when fares drop, people are more likely to use it. There's no shortage of opportunities and ideas to increase usage and to reduce fares, and incentivise people to use public transport. The challenge always is the resource. So, I'm not sure how the Conservatives plan to fund that initiative that they had in their manifesto, but there are no easy options that I'm aware of to do just that.We do have an offer on buses where people aged between 16 and 21 have a third off an adult bus ticket, and we've been doing a lot of work, as part of our commitment to a fairer fares regime, to model what we could achieve if we had much lower bus fares. And the figures are all very encouraging; the resource is the challenge.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: 2. What support is the Welsh Government providing for coastal communities facing the threat of flooding? OQ59079\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Janet. The Welsh Government is investing \u00a3293 million in reducing flood risk to coastal communities across Wales through our coastal risk management programme. This will reduce flood risk to over 15,000 properties, and includes, for example, more than \u00a319 million of investment in Aberconwy. An interactive map showing our investment is published online.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Minister. I'm sure you're aware that, in 2014, our lovely sandy beach, north shore, Llandudno, received, without any notice, the dumping of some 50,000 tonnes of freshly and dirty quarried rock. At the time, it was described as 'shingle'. The town was in uproar, with residents, visitors and business owners still angry to this day. I can recall our sea washing up a white, milky froth for around three weeks, whilst this was described at the time as 'clean and inert shingle.'&nbsp;Now, in 2023\u2014well, sooner than that, actually\u2014we're now aware of the several options that have been brought forward to you to bring forward a new sea water flood defence scheme. One of the options is to implement a scheme that would replace sand, and stage 1 was even supported. I cannot overemphasise my immense disappointment that this scheme now will not be supported, as you feel that the cost outweighs the aesthetic benefits of using sand renourishment. Llandudno is the queen of the Welsh resorts, and the jewel in the crown\u2014&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: I'm going to have to call you to ask your question now, because I'm about to ask you to ask your spokespeople questions, of which there are three. So, can you ask your question?\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What steps, Minister, can you take? How do we move forward on this? What steps will you take to ensure that we have the right sea defences we need, but that, at some stage, we can see our sandy beach restored in Llandudno? Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nJulie James AM: Yes, thank you, Janet. So, just to be really specific, the Welsh Government have recently awarded grant funding to Conwy County Borough Council to develop a full business case for Llandudno, based on maintaining and improving the existing cobble defence on the north shore. The alternative sand option provides no additional flood benefit, at a much greater cost to the coastal risk management programme, and that's the problem. So, whilst I completely understand what you're saying about the sandy beach, the coastal risk management programme is for coastal risk management; it's not for tourist attractions and other aesthetic value. I'm not denying the value of that; I'm just saying that's not what the programme is for.&nbsp;So, if Conwy County Borough Council want to get an alternative sand option at Llandudno north shore, they really need to look for alternative sources of funding. There are some other sources of funding available, but, in all conscience, I cannot take a coastal management programme that's specifically designed to protect places from flooding and use it for a completely different purpose. So, whilst I have some sympathy with what you're saying, this is not the right programme for it. And, you can tell from the amount of money that we've invested around the coast of Wales that we are really trying to get as many properties protected from actual flooding as possible. Clearly, we do try to do that in the most environmentally and aesthetically pleasing way possible, but, in the end, it's down to how many properties we protect. So, I'm sure you'll be able to work with the council to get a better option, but not through this funding model.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Janet Finch-Saunders.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Diolch, Llywydd, and thank you, Minister, Now, there is no denying that the UK Government is taking decisive action to tackle unsafe buildings. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP has sent all developers legally binding contracts that will commit them to pay to repair these unsafe buildings. This contract will see developers commit an estimated \u00a32 billion or more for repairs to buildings that they've developed or refurbished over the past 30 years, and protect thousands of leaseholders living in hundreds of buildings across England.&nbsp;In England, the UK Government is looking to prevent developers from operating freely in the housing market if they fail to sign and comply with the remediation contract. Will you do the same for those operating in Wales who either refuse to sign or breach the terms of the Welsh Government's developers pact?\n\n"}

The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Vikki Howells.&nbsp;\n\nVikki Howells AM: 1. How is the Welsh Government working to improve the provision of health services for the people of Cynon Valley? OQ59213\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. A series of national programmes assist the health board in providing improved access to its services. These programmes offer the most up-to-date clinical advice and access to latest best practice so that standards can be improved in all parts of Wales, including the Cynon valley.\n\nVikki Howells AM: Thank you for your answer, First Minister, and I was really pleased to hear the announcement last month about the new diagnostics and treatment centre for south-east Wales, to be based in Rhondda Cynon Taf. This could not just reduce, but actually eliminate, backlogs in accessing treatment and substantially reduce waiting times, moving forward, for orthopedic surgeries in particular, for people in Cynon valley and neighbouring areas.&nbsp;Can you provide any information on timescales for delivery of this key project and, in addition, outline what help Welsh Government will be providing to health boards to get this new centre up and running?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Vikki Howells for that question, and for drawing attention to that very important development in the RCT area. And, Llywydd, it's a genuine example, I think, of the social partnership approach in Wales in action. The three buildings that are to be used were first identified by the local authority. They drew them to the attention of the health board. The health board had negotiations with the current private sector occupant of the buildings. The health board then involved itself in discussions with the wider south-east Wales health community, and the financial help to acquire the buildings was provided through the Welsh Government. So, there you have local government, the health service, the private sector and the Welsh Government all collectively involved in bringing about a development that, as Vikki Howells said, will lead to significant new capacity for residents in this part of Wales.&nbsp;In terms of timescales, it's important to remember that the building is still occupied by its current owner, but there will be a period over the next 12 months in which they bring their use of the building to an end, and diagnostic capacity, which will be the first phase of the new development, will be worked up by the health board, its partners, including the Welsh Government, and that will be the first phase in the next calendar year. And then, once that is developed, there will be physical space at the buildings to have dedicated elective capacity, with a particular focus on orthopaedic care, which will, as Vikki Howells said, Llywydd, make an important difference to patients in that part of Wales, in accelerating their access to treatment. And the Welsh Government will be there not just with the financial help we've offered so far, but, as I said in my original answer, by making sure that the health board has access to those national programmes, those national clinical leads, which will help to make sure that the most advantage can be derived from this new development.\n\nJoel James MS: First Minister, according to Stats Wales, in December 2022, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which covers the Cynon valley, along with Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and the rest of Rhondda Cynon Taf, had a staggering 13,732 patients waiting more than 14 weeks for diagnostic and therapy services, out of a population of 450,000. This represents 36 per cent of the total amount of people waiting more than 14 weeks in Wales. Cwm Taf health board also had 31,992 patients waiting over eight weeks, which represented 18 per cent of the Welsh total, which is, sadly, further evidence of the postcode lottery that exists in Wales with the health service.&nbsp;To put these figures into perspective, for the same month, the whole of London, which has a population of over nine million people, had a similar amount of 32,953 people waiting more than six weeks. Recent Office for National Statistics data shows that, out of the 331 areas in the United Kingdom, Merthyr Tydfil is officially the sickest place, with almost 10 per cent of the population in very bad health, whilst RCT is sixth and Bridgend is thirteenth. As you know, recent news shows that Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has now been put back into special measures, and the British Dental Association has warned that NHS dentistry in Wales could soon disappear, with the chairman of the BDA's Welsh general committee stating that Welsh NHS dentistry in its current state is unlikely to exist in a year or two's time. With this in mind, First Minister, what steps has the Welsh Government taken to improve on these appalling statistics? Thank you.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, it's being so cheerful that keeps him going, Llywydd\u2014it's certainly not the accuracy of his grasp of the facts. In some ways, the Member managed to answer his own question, eventually, by pointing to the fact that the reason why there are percentages of that sort waiting in Cwm Taf is because of the nature of the population it serves. It's not a postcode lottery at all; it's as the Member eventually managed to say\u2014it is because Cwm Taf Morgannwg serves one of the oldest and sickest populations that we see anywhere in Wales. And the demand for health services reflects the needs of that local population. It's all the better news, therefore, that the development that Vikki Howells pointed to will accelerate access not simply to diagnostic services, but to planned operations for people in that part of Wales.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: 2. What progress has the Welsh Government made on embedding prudent healthcare into every aspect of health and well-being in Cardiff Central? OQ59234\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Jenny Rathbone for that question. Llywydd, value-based healthcare continues to take forward the prudent healthcare principles of ill-health prevention, joint partnership with patients on the journey to improvement, and diversification of the workforce so that every practitioner operates at the top of their clinical licence.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: First Minister, I'm sure you will want to celebrate the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, mindful of the well-being of their staff, and inviting them to take part in courses on how to grow vegetables on the Llandough hospital site, obviously funded by the Cardiff and Vale health board charity\u2014something, I'm sure, close to both our hearts. But I also want to highlight their recent work on tackling the enduring epidemic of mental illness. Referrals to secondary care remain almost as high as they were during the pandemic. So, they've been training barbers to recognise signs of mental distress amongst their customers, and they're training people with lived experience of enduring mental health problems as tutors, to work alongside professional clinical tutors, involving individual patients and families and friends in a whole-system recovery, through something called the recovery college. How can this really creative response to the shortage of applicants to fill staff vacancies be deepened across Government, to help shrink the disparity in the numbers of years lived well between different socioeconomic groups, so harshly exposed by COVID? In Cardiff, it's 12 years.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Jenny Rathbone for that. I certainly share her enthusiasm for the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, at their Llandough site, in using the ground that they have available there for well-being initiatives. The fruit that is being grown in part of the western edge of that site offers patients as well as people who work for the health board an opportunity to be outside, in the fresh air, and with access to the things that we know improve individuals' sense of well-being.As far as the mental health impact of the pandemic is concerned, it continues to be seen in all parts of Wales. The Welsh Government's new investment in mental health is often very much concentrated in that prudent healthcare part of the spectrum: investment in tier 0 and tier 1 services, and the 111 'press 2' service that's available 24 hours every day in the Cardiff and Vale health board area, and with a publicity campaign, Llywydd, which will take place throughout this month, to increase patients' awareness and use of that very valuable service. I'm very struck by what the Member said, Llywydd, about the way in which it is possible to harness the efforts of people who aren't in the health service at all to be part of the work of identifying and attending to patients needs as early as possible when those needs arise. I do recall, some years ago now, when I was health Minister, visiting Pen-y-groes, a Welsh-speaking area in the Ammanford coalfield, to see a dementia service and being told by the GPs who ran it that their most important source of referrals were hairdressers on the main street of the village, because those hairdressers knew their clientele\u2014they could spot the person who wasn't quite managing as well as they used to, with the money, with the organisation, and they would make an early referral into the dementia service, so that people could get that preventative intervention that is possible when you manage to identify people early on that journey. The barbers in Cardiff, the postal workers in Cardiff, who we know have those day in, day out interactions on the doorstep, all these are people who we can make helpful to the health service in that prudent healthcare way.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, last week, my colleague Janet Finch-Saunders, along with other MSs, hosted a meeting about the cladding situation here in Wales, and the Welsh Cladiators, who have been pioneering the lobbying work and the projection of the plight of many home owners here in Wales who are caught up in this, really should be commended by all Members in this Chamber. One of the asks among many was why isn't the Welsh Government coming forward and adopting the legislation that has been put down in England, to take sections 116 and 125, to give rights to leaseholders so that they themselves can exercise those rights in holding the developers to account. I've heard Mike Hedges, one of your backbenchers, speak in favour of this in the Chamber when speaking to the leader of the house. There's cross-party support for this. We had a debate prior to Christmas. Will the Government reconsider its view, in light of the ongoing crisis that many home owners here in Wales face?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, first of all, I join with the leader of the opposition in congratulating those people who continue to campaign on this issue to make sure that the Welsh Government is always aware of developments that they are in touch with and that their views are conveyed to us. And I know that last week's meeting was an opportunity for that to happen, and the Minister will be following that up in her forthcoming meeting with the strategic safety stakeholder group, where these matters can be further debated, and the Minister keeps all those arguments about sections 118 to section 125 under review.The position, though, is that those regulations\u2014those sections\u2014were specifically written for the building safety regime in England. It is not as simple as simply picking them up and dropping them into the very different Welsh context. And there are some disadvantages for leaseholders who find themselves within that regime, because here in Wales our intention is that leaseholders should not be required to pay for the remedial action that is required to their buildings, whereas those sections expose leaseholders to bills up to \u00a310,000, and we don't intend to do that in Wales. So, while we will continue to keep the position under close review, we're not convinced that a simple drag-and-drop of those sections into the Welsh context would deliver what the campaigners say it would deliver, and we're not convinced that it could not actually act to their detriment.&nbsp;\n\n"}

You'll remember that we received evidence from the Minister at the end of the spring term, and we will be hearing from her again at the end of this first stage. But, before us today we have two academics who I'm sure are going to contribute to the scrutiny work, and therefore I welcome Dr Victoria Jenkins, associate professor in law with Swansea University, and Professor Enda Hayes, who is a professor of air quality and carbon management in the University of the West of England. A very warm welcome to you both and thank you for joining us. We'll go straight to questions, and I know that Janet Finch-Saunders wants to ask the first question. Thank you.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, bore da. Is the Bill, as currently drafted, sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in air quality in Wales and soundscapes? And if not, why not?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: Do you want&nbsp;to go first?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: A nice easy question to start. So, air quality and the challenge of dealing with air quality is not new. Since the Environment Act 1995, which is 25 years ago, we've been trying to address this challenge and, to be very honest, we have fundamentally failed. We're very good at diagnosing the problem; we're just not very good at solving it. Now, there are elements of this Bill that I think are going to have a fundamental effect, a positive effect on that challenge. Part of the issues around the Environment Act was the wording of the Act\u2014that you had to work in 'pursuit' of the air quality objectives. We now have got stronger language saying that we have to 'secure' them. So, that's good. Updating of the strategy on a more regular basis, evidence-based targets I think are all really, really positive steps. The bit that worries me is I get a tone from the Bill that we're almost starting from scratch, and we're not. We've got 25-30 years of evidence behind us, which means, I think, we can be a lot more ambitious in terms of the timelines, the targets and how we are going to get there. So, it's Marmite for me at the moment, because there are some bits that I think are really, really good and will solve a lot of the issues and will help us progress in terms of addressing the problems, but it just feels like we can do more.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And we'll come on to some of those individual issues, I'm sure. Dr Jenkins.\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: My interest in this Bill is in relation to how we balance, and my interest generally in terms of environmental law is how we create that balance between giving policy makers and giving Government the discretion to take action to achieve something, but at the same time ensuring accountability. So, that's where I think law may have done us a disservice in the past, and that, moving forward, we need more innovative approaches in that respect. And, from that perspective, I think there are, again, some good bits of this Bill, which are really attempting to put into place a robust framework. I should say I've been an environmental academic lawyer for over 20 years, but I don't specialise in air quality law specifically, so I'm less familiar with the science, but that's why Professor Hayes is here. So, I would say it makes it a little bit trickier for me to talk about the ambition of the Bill in those circumstances, but I'm here to discuss the framework and how it sits today in terms of that balance between discretionary powers and accountability.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Excellent. We will indeed be pursuing some of those points, as well, in a moment, but I'll come to Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I want to go through a specific point right at the outset, which is the scope of the Bill. You touched on the point about starting from scratch. Well, actually, we have various policies in place. One of them is the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013. I declared my interest earlier on there. Now, the active travel group have submitted evidence to this about whether we need to finish some unfinished business that could have been done at the time of the original active travel Act. It's to do with things such as duties to promote active travel, which we've failed to do, et cetera. Now, within the Bill, the Bill addresses two specific, distinct purposes\u2014and my thanks for the briefing note on this\u2014improving air quality, and assessing and managing noise. The cross-party group submission makes the point that Welsh Government state that, in their clean air plan, transport is now the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, predominantly due to emissions from road transport, accounting for approximately one third of emissions, and also, within the explanatory memorandum to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill, it states that our 27 noise maps suggest the homes of more than 200,000 people across Wales are exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organization's 2009 night-noise guidelines, and make the point that the most significant way to deal with this is shifting people away from road use, motorised vehicles, into active travel, walking and cycling, and they suggest some amendments. Have you had time to look at that? Sorry for the extensive preamble, but have you had time to look at that, to express an opinion as to whether you think amendments on active travel would fall within the scope of this Bill? And if you haven't\u2014and I realise you may not\u2014would you be able to go away and have a look at this to see whether you think that those may fall within the scope, because the Llywydd will ultimately have to make a decision on this?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I haven't had a chance to look at it before coming today. I do think that the active travel legislation is significant in the context of air quality and public health, and from my perspective, as an environmental lawyer as well, it's particularly important in bringing together our objectives in Wales in relation to both public health and environmental protection. So, it's certainly, from that perspective, something that I would consider important.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I haven't had a chance to look at it either, but what I would say is that when you're looking at solutions, particularly for transport, active travel is essential. You've got to get to that point. I think, for years, we've been very much orientated in our solutions towards technocentric solutions. So, these are cleaner vehicles, cleaner fuels. That will only get us so far; the scale of the problem here means that we have to look at behavioural interventions, which means getting more people out of vehicles, onto bikes, and out of cars. That's a given. There are a lot of things you have to address to get around that: affordability, accessibility, reliability\u2014all those things that come with public transport\u2014and safety issues around active travel infrastructure, things like that. It's essential. If we're going to solve this problem, then we've got to deal with it.The other point that I might add, if I may, is that what we're dealing with here is a public health issue. It's a public health issue. So, if you're looking at active travel interventions, those interventions will have the core benefits of also working towards better public health. So, it isn't just about improving air quality; it's also the benefits you get elsewhere. So, it's essential, in my mind.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Rather than delay the committee, then, Chair\u2014and thank you for those answers; so, in principle, you've got no objection and, in fact, you can see the benefits of it\u2014I wonder if I could, perhaps, be cheeky enough to ask you to go away and look at it, perhaps discuss it with colleagues in law and whatever to see whether you think it falls within the scope of the two aims of this Bill.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: Okay.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Janet, did you want to come back in on something? And then we'll come back to Huw.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Thank you, Chair. All it was, when we take evidence during the forming of new Bills, quite often, one thing that comes up is that we haven't collected enough data. Now, you say that we look like we're almost at the start again, but a lot of years have gone before. Has the Welsh Government been proactive in collecting the relevant data so that any Bill going forward will be based on really good evidence, if you like?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I can start there. You can always get more data, is the short answer. You can always have more, it can always be better. Across Wales, if we're looking at air quality monitoring data, we've got a pretty extensive network of monitoring sites. I think, from memory, there are about fortyish continuous analysers run by local authorities, and about 10 to 12 analysers connected to the automatic urban and rural network. There's plenty of data already out there. Now, that can always be improved, and I think the tone of the Bill means that we'll have to think differently about how we monitor. So, at the moment, we've monitored for compliance, we've monitored where we've got problematic areas, where we've got these hotspots, where we've got these risks of exceedances. This Bill, again, seems to be more orientated towards prevention, being more proactive\u2014again, the public health side of the issue\u2014which means we have to think differently about how we monitor in terms of understanding public health, and bringing that air quality, health, deprivation triple jeopardy into the equation. So, we've got plenty to start from; we can always have more, and we will have to think differently because the Bill is orientating our approach slightly differently.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Fine.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Let me come on, then, to ask for your views on the Welsh Government's decision, as it stands, to set air quality targets in regulations rather than on the face of the Bill. And their argument is that this will give greater flexibility to respond to the latest guidance and to futureproof the Bill. Do you have sympathy with that or would you prefer to see air quality targets bang on the face of the Bill?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I think this is a question for me in the sense that, if you say too much on the face of primary legislation like this, then you are impinging your discretion to take action as things proceed and as scientific knowledge and understanding moves on. So, it is often a good idea to create a power to introduce regulations. That said, the issue then becomes, well, to what extent do you give the Government discretion, or the Executive discretion, to bring in those regulations and what's the framework for that. So, currently, there is quite a lot of discretion now given to the Executive in that respect, and that's something that you might want to consider further.\n\n"}

Reduced demand for services", "B. Increased workforce", "C. Potential pressure on local authority services", "D. Decreased funding from the Welsh Government"], "answer": "C", "content": "John Griffiths AM: We will move on to item 2 on our agenda today, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our first evidence session with the Welsh Local Government Association. So, let me welcome our witnesses, then: Councillor Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council and leader of the Welsh Local Government Association; Anthony Hunt, leader of Torfaen County Borough Council; Councillor Llinos Medi, leader of Anglesey county council; Christina Harrhy, chief executive of Caerphilly County Borough Council; and Chris Llewelyn, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association. So, croeso, welcome to you all.Perhaps I might begin, then, with some general questions by way of an overview, and firstly, then, for the Welsh Local Government Association to provide a brief overview of the current financial situation facing local authorities in Wales. Andrew, I guess that's you.\n\nAndrew Morgan: Thank you, Chair. If I can just start, and perhaps I'll hand over to my colleagues. I think it's fair to say that the pressure this financial year and going into the next financial year is on a scale that, certainly in my time of being a councillor, which is since 2004, we've not faced. In terms of double-digit inflation, it's bad enough, but there obviously is the pressure on the pay award, which is agreed across England and Wales, which is considerable this year, but not least as well in terms of energy costs and supply chain costs. If you consider food costs for things like school meals, our care home services and meals on wheels, food costs have gone up anything between 14 and 25 per cent. Our gas and energy costs are predicted for this financial year for local authorities in Wales to go up around 355 per cent for gas, and well over 100 per cent for electric. So, there are some real pressures on local authorities. I know every year we talk about the pressures on local government, whether it's service demand such as social services in particular, but this year I think it is quite exceptional.Local government is facing a significant overspend this year\u2014in excess of \u00a3200 million is the figure that we have collated between the 22 authorities. I think it's fair to say that since devolution, local government has never overspent \u00a3200 million in a single financial year. My own authority is set to overspend by around \u00a320 million this year, so we'll be using reserves, and most local authorities are looking to use reserves. And next year, even though we are having a very good settlement from&nbsp;the Welsh Government, and we are grateful for the additional funding that's been passported on, there is going to be significant pressure on local authorities to set a balanced budget. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Andrew. Any other of our witnesses? Anthony.&nbsp;\n\nAnthony Hunt: Thank you, Chair. The pressures are substantial. We estimate \u00a3784 million cumulatively to the end of the next financial year. Just in social care, for example, it's \u00a395.2 million of pressures, \u00a332 million from children's residential placements, adult residential placements \u00a312 million, adult domiciliary care \u00a37.5 million. Just to use my own authority as an example, our energy costs are estimated to rise by \u00a34 million, our social care costs by \u00a34 million, and our pay bill by just over \u00a37 million. Those are real pressures that can't just be managed away easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Would any other of our witnesses like to add anything to what Andrew or Anthony have said? Llinos.&nbsp;\n\nLlinos Medi: I think in addition to the cost pressures and inflation is the service demand as well that we're seeing a massive increase in, due to the cost-of-living crisis. So, it's a perfect storm of the demand on services and the cost of delivering the services at the same time.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Diolch yn fawr. In terms of the experience during the pandemic, where, obviously, local authorities again were under tremendous pressure, how would you compare the current situation with the situation at that time? Who would like to offer a view on that? Christina.&nbsp;\n\nChristina Harrhy: I think that the big difference here is that throughout COVID the Welsh Government helpfully provided us with some short-term funding. And as Llinos has already mentioned, as we're coming out of COVID, there's increased demand, but it's not only increased demand, it's increased complexity of demand. And then when you couple that with the depleted workforce\u2014. Because one of the things that has happened post COVID is that, for a number of reasons, a lot of public servants have decided to leave public service. Coupled with the reduced funding that we are facing, the increased demand and complexity, and a depleted workforce and difficulty in recruiting and retention, I think it's essentially a perfect storm. Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Christina. Llinos.&nbsp;\n\nLlinos Medi: I will be speaking in Welsh; I didn't use the interpretation earlier. It's also important that we note that during COVID, normal services had a period where they weren't necessarily being provided, so we were focused on the COVID crisis. Now, we have a cost-of-living crisis on top of all the other crises hitting society, as well as the financial crisis that we as an authority are facing. But planning expectations continue, and public protection and all the other requirements placed upon us as an authority remain, and we can't cope with all of these crises as well as business as usual and public expectation on local authorities. And much of that, of course, is statutory, for example planning and so on. So, the pressure now is more intense because of that.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Diolch yn fawr, Llinos. Andrew, did you want to come in as well?\n\nAndrew Morgan: Yes, just to add to and support what Christina Harrhy said. Obviously, during the pandemic, we did receive extraordinary amounts of funding, both to support communities and to support services, and certainly end-of-year funding as well, which has obviously helped our balances, carrying forward to this year, which has now helped us in terms of overspends. But the difficulty is of course that that was an exceptional amount of funding, and one-off funding, to deal with the short-term problem. In effect, the pandemic was a short-term hit for things like income, which has largely recovered in lots of areas, though there are some legacy issues there. But going forward now, general revenue, in terms of our revenue budget, is under massive pressure from four key drivers\u2014the inflation, the energy costs, the service demand, and pay pressures. All of them are almost like a perfect storm for public services across the board, and local authorities are no different.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thank you very much for that. Obviously, the potential impact on services is something that all of us will be very concerned about. Is there anything in particular you would like to say in terms of that potential impact? Is there anything that you'd like to highlight? Andrew.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew Morgan: Every local authority will have to address this, obviously, as part of their budget-setting round and the various consultations they're doing. But even though we've had a relatively good settlement, it has to be said\u2014the average figure is much more positive than was anticipated, with consequentials being passed on\u2014there is a range from the low end, such as authorities like myself and Merthyr, to, I think, Monmouthshire, which is at the higher end this year, and Cardiff. So, there is obviously fluctuation in the formula, but the formula is there because it is driven by demand, such as population, school numbers, and various other drivers, which impact on that.But turning back to individual councils setting their budgets, there's no getting away from the fact that there will be some tough decisions. There is a balance to be struck between council tax increases at a significant rate, making savings where possible without impacting on services, but, undoubtedly, there will be other cuts to services, or service changes that, I think I'm fair in saying, all 22 local authorities will have to consider to a certain extent. That may be changing things like bin services, it could be cutting or closing some sports facilities; there is a whole raft of things that local authorities are considering, but it is obviously down to those individual authorities to make those tough decisions.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Okay. Llinos.\n\nLlinos Medi: I know that you're already aware of this, so I don't want to be\u2014. But this is us making cuts to services that have previously been cut, so the options are very few and far between. And when we've been able to maintain some semblance of service in some areas, it may mean that may have to disappear, and clearly that's a real cause of concern. So it's important to note that we weren't in an ideal starting point. I sometimes fear that we forget about the decades of cuts that we've undertaken already.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Yes. Anthony.\n\nAnthony Hunt: I just wanted to come back to the point that Christina made about workforce\u2014that's a very important one, looking to the medium term. This isn't just a cash issue, this is an issue with more and more people deciding to walk away from public services. They've seen their pay depleted by 20 per cent over the past decade, they're expected to continually do more with less, with fewer staff, and I really feel that we're staring in the face of a recruitment crisis within some key public services. We're seeing it in social care, in domiciliary care, and we're seeing it actually in more areas than I've ever seen before, where we're really struggling to recruit to key posts. And after all, public services are the sum total of the people who work in them, so I think that's an issue that we have to look into as well.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Thanks for that. We will come on to these matters in a little more detail later on. Before I bring in other committee members, could I just ask one further question? I think it was Llinos who mentioned that demand is obviously significant, and so have others of you. We hear reports that Welsh Government, in response to the pressures that hospitals face, and emergency services face, will be encouraging discharges from hospital perhaps without care packages being fully in place at that stage. Is there anything that you'd like to say about that in terms of the potential pressure on local authority services? Andrew.\n\n"}

We're undertaking Stage 2 proceedings today for the Agriculture (Wales) Bill. We have the Minister with us today, Lesley Griffiths, and her officials. Would you like to just introduce your officials for the record?\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly. Thank you, Chair. So, over on my left, I have Emma Davies, who is the agricultural Bill manager and Dorian Brunt, who is the senior lawyer for the rural affairs team. And on my right, Hannah Fernandez, head of policy instructions for the Bill, and Mark Alexander, deputy director for land management reform.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you for that, Minister, and welcome to you all.So, the marshalled list of amendments is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled, marshalled into the order that has been agreed by the committee on 16 February. The groupings list shows how amendments have been grouped in order to facilitate the debates today, and the order in which the amendments are called and moved for a vote is dictated by the marshalled list.&nbsp;So, I want to\u2014. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair, I will move the amendments in the name of the Minister, and for expediency, I will assume that the Minister wants to move all of the amendments that have been tabled in her name at the appropriate time, in accordance with the marshalled list. Minister, if you don't&nbsp;want me to do that, then please indicate at the relevant point in the proceedings.So, in line with our usual practice, we've got legal advisers to the committee who are present today and that means that we can suspend proceedings should Members wish to take advantage of that at any time\u2014that legal advice. And in addition, Minister, you can also receive advice, of course, from your officials, hopefully by passing a note, of if you wish to do so, we can suspend proceedings as well, should you need us to do that.\n\nDarren Millar AM: So, we'll start with group 1 of the 16 groups that we have to discuss today: the sustainable land management objectives and the first group of amendments that we're going to be discussing. The lead amendment in this group is amendment 57. I therefore call on Luke Fletcher to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group. I call on Luke Fletcher.\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd, and I move the amendments. And right off the bat, I'd just like to thank the clerks and legal team for their patience with myself as a new Member in going through this process.I'll speak to amendments 57, 1A, 3 and 4. On amendment 57, this amendment seeks to include a requirement relating to protecting food security in SLM objectives. Food security is a critical issue. It directly impacts the health and well-being of people, the environment and economy. Wales has a high level of poverty and food insecurity, particularly among low-income households, which can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Sustainable land management can help to address this issue by promoting the production of nutritious, affordable and locally grown food.&nbsp;Although clause 1 within the Bill includes the production of food as part of the first SLM objective, what we are seeking to do is to provide a clear target for meeting this objective, which must be around ensuring the food security of citizens and access to food to promote good health and well-being.On amendment 1A, which is an amendment, actually, to amendment 1, we're seeking to change 'farmer' to 'active farmer' to ensure that we are clear as to who receives support.On amendment 3, economic resilience is just as important to Welsh farmers as environmental resilience because it is essential for their long-term sustainability and ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions. By investing in both economic and environmental resilience, farmers can build a sustainable and profitable farming operation that can withstand the challenges of the future.And finally, Chair, on amendment 4,&nbsp;'The fifth objective is to seek to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities, recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and agricultural production to the rural economy, and in doing so\u2014'(a) to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and'(b) to contribute to achieving the well-being goals in section 4 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.'\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Luke. I call on Sam Kurtz.\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd like to echo Luke Fletcher's thanks and praise to the legal team and the clerking team for their hand-holding through this process. I am most grateful for that. Speaking to amendment 1, it has been tabled in order to remove any ambiguity in relation to the sustainable land management objective 4. By precisely linking the fourth objective to the role of the farmer, we seek to recognise their integral role in supporting and delivering the objectives of the sustainable land management objective 4. This sits in line with recommendation 10 of the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee report into the Agriculture (Wales) Bill, which seeks to provide explicit policy intent for the support of strong and vibrant rural communities, as was sought by key industry stakeholders.&nbsp;Touching on amendment 1A, I would like to welcome this from Luke Fletcher, and therefore will be supporting it. In relation to amendment 43, the inclusion of the phrase 'landscape' has been made in order to remove any ambiguity about the land we seek to conserve, enhance and promote, as outlined within the fourth objective of this legislation, making it more explicit than 'countryside' alone\u2014indeed, looking at every form of land, be that mountains, uplands, moorlands, seascapes, semi-urban areas, et cetera. So, through recognising this, we also seek to acknowledge that each category possesses its own unique, distinctive character and, with that, separate necessities that require tailored support and assistance.Speaking to amendment 2, the use of the phrase 'existing' has been chosen to, once again, remove any ambiguity as to what farmers should be seeking to promote\u2014in this instance, public access within land designated for agricultural purposes. I'm sure that the Minister will be familiar with the reservations that some have made with regard to public access, especially should that be land that is home to farm animals. What this amendment seeks to do is secure existing public access and provide landowners with a key objective through which they can seek to enhance existing access. By permitting this, we can seek to alleviate significant barriers to increasing the public's connection with and understanding of the natural environment.&nbsp;Speaking to amendment 3, this has been tabled to strengthen the fourth objective in order to recognise the significance of rural economic viability through the means of protecting farm businesses. By protecting, enhancing and promoting the countryside and landscape, cultural resources and public access, we encompass the wider role of the rural economy, sustaining its viability. This amendment seeks to formally recognise that arrangement and enshrine it on the statute book, in line with the aspiration set out within recommendation 10 of the committee report.&nbsp;And finally, Chair, amendment 4 has been tabled with the purpose of introducing a fifth sustainable land management objective, one that seeks to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities through recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and the practice of agricultural production to the rural economy. Land management decisions to achieve the biodiversity, climate and sustainable food objectives cannot be divorced from the economic and social needs or influences that farming families and food supply chain businesses experience. Therefore, we are highly unlikely to achieve our aims at the scale and pace required unless we protect and enhance the economic viability of families and communities delivering the outcomes within the sustainable land management objectives. Thank you, Chair.\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. Are there any other members of the committee who wish to speak? If there aren't, then I call on the Minister.&nbsp;\n\nLesley Griffiths AM: Thank you very much, Chair. I'd just like to begin by thanking Members for their remarks, for their amendments to the Bill and for this opportunity to set out the Government's position regarding them all. I just want to assure Members that both I and my officials have really considered the amendments in detail. Obviously, I'll respond to each amendment in turn and then also introduce amendment 29, which is tabled in my name.Amendment 57: the first amendment in this group alters the first objective so that contributing to the sustainable production of food and other goods is'to protect or improve the food security of citizens and access to food that promotes good health and wellbeing.\u2019Welsh agriculture has a key role to play as the producer of high-quality food, helping to feed our nation and other nations. Food security and access to food that promotes good health and well-being is, however, much, much wider than that, relating to supply-chain considerations, wages, transport, the availability of shops, benefits, healthcare, housing, et cetera. And of course, most of these lie outside the scope of this agricultural Bill, which is why this amendment cannot be accepted.Amendment 1 and amendment 1A, which is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective: the purpose of amendment 1 and amendment 1A appears to seek to limit the fourth SLM objective to farmers, or active farmers only. The concepts of 'farmer' or 'active farmer' do not appear in the Bill, and none of the SLM objectives refer to these terms. So, it's not the policy intention to limit the fourth SLM objective in this way. Introducing this concept now could have unknown consequences for other parts of the Bill. So, for example, a reference in one place of the Bill to a 'farmer' or an 'active farmer' may imply that other parts of the Bill do not apply to the farmer or active farmer. And this is a possible consequence that I'm sure all Members would wish to avoid.&nbsp;Amendment 43: this is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective to refer specifically to landscapes in the countryside, and I don't think this amendment is necessary, as non-urban landscapes are considered to be captured within the term 'countryside', which is already referenced in the fourth objective.&nbsp;Amendment 2 to the fourth SLM objective would limit scope of public access under that provision to what is existing only. Public access is not static, it changes through the actions of farmers and landowners, and others updating access rights. So, restricting action to existing public access is therefore contrary to the policy intention to promote public access to the countryside and our cultural resources.&nbsp;Amendment 3: as I've just mentioned, none of the SLM objectives refer to farmer or any other beneficiary or actor. So, it's therefore not appropriate to include a reference to protecting their economic viability.Amendment 4: this amendment introduces a new SLM objective that is not required. Having resilient agriculture businesses that contribute to our thriving rural communities and help sustain current and future generations of farmers is important. And the intention of this amendment appears to seek to ensure that the Government, potentially, underwrites rural livelihoods, which is outside of the scope of the Bill, and not appropriate. It would also exclude non-rural communities, where agriculture and ancillary activities may take place. And the proposed Government amendment 29 recognises the importance of agricultural businesses in the communities in which they operate.Amendment 29, I'm very pleased to bring this forward, it is the result of productive discussions with Plaid Cymru, as part of the co-operation agreement. The amendment makes provision about factors relevant to determining whether food and other goods are produced in a sustainable manner for the purposes of the first SLM objective. The amendment is intended to highlight the link between the production of food and other goods in a sustainable way, and the resilience of agricultural businesses within the communities in which they operate. Resilient agricultural businesses are vitally important to Wales, contributing to our thriving rural communities, and sustaining Welsh agricultural land for our future generations. Businesses that are resilient and adaptive are more likely to thrive and survive shocks to the sector, such as those we've seen caused by pandemics, conflicts, supply chain issues and climate change. So, I therefore ask that Members agree my amendment 29, and do not agree amendments 57 and 1A in the name of Luke Fletcher, and amendments 1, 43, 2, 3 and 4 in the name of Sam Kurtz. Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you, Minister. I call on Luke Fletcher to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: Diolch, Cadeirydd. It's naturally disappointing that the Government won't be supporting our amendments. On amendment 57, I think it's important to note that, with the other sustainable land management objectives having much more of an environmental and social focus, it is vital that the sustainable land management objective has clarity around the food production and food security goals. Chair, I propose that we move to a vote.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Thank you. So, the question is that amendment 57 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] There is an objection, so we'll proceed to a vote. Those in favour, please raise your hands. And those against. So, I can see that there's a tied vote, so I use my casting vote in the negative, that is, against the amendment, in accordance with Standing Order 6.20(ii). Therefore, amendment 57 is not agreed.&nbsp;\n\nDarren Millar AM: Luke Fletcher, before we dispose of amendment 1, we need to dispose of the amendment to that amendment, which has been tabled in your name\u2014amendment 1A. Do you move that amendment?\n\nLuke Fletcher MS: I move.\n\n"}

So, thank you very much, Lara, for joining us. We've got your paper, so we've all read it. I wonder if you could set out what the Welsh Government has done, in its vision and frameworks, to support implementation of a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence.\n\nLara Snowdon: Prynhawn da, Chair. Chair, sorry, would you mind repeating the question? I had a technical issue at the start. Your voice was duplicated. Apologies.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Don't worry. Obviously, there's a new policy action by the Welsh Government on gender-based violence, and, obviously, you're arguing very strongly for a public health approach. Could you tell us how the Welsh Government has approached the vision and the frameworks to ensure that we are implementing a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence?\n\nLara Snowdon: Thank you, Chair. We really welcome the inclusion of a public health approach in the violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy. I think it will be really key to achieving the goal in the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Act 2015 of ensuring that the Welsh Government implements preventative practice to prevent VAWDASV. However, I think it's fair to say that, at the moment, the approach in Wales is very much in its infancy. So, we have this high-level commitment in the strategy, but there is still a lot of work, really, to do to embed that approach in practice across Wales.We have the blueprint approach as well, which is one of the commitments of the new VAWDASV strategy, and I think that will be really key in terms of developing multi-agency practice for VAWDASV prevention, which is a key part of a public health approach. It's also a tried-and-tested model that has been used for youth justice and women's justice in Wales, and, I think, particularly to navigate the complexities of the devolved and non-devolved landscape as well. So, I think we have this high-level commitment, I think there's a recognition that we should be taking a public health approach, and particularly focusing on prevention, which is really important, and I welcome the focus of the inquiry on it today, but we still have quite a long way to go in terms of actually developing what that looks like in practice.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, when you talk about a blueprint approach, you're meaning a collaborative approach, are you?\n\nLara Snowdon: Yes, that's right. So, one of the commitments in the strategy was to take a blueprint approach, which is an approach that has been developed in Wales, particularly with youth justice and women's justice, and it's really a multi-agency action plan. So, it takes that systematic approach that we look for in a public health approach.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. So, how well are public and private sector organisations engaging with understanding this public health approach?\n\nLara Snowdon: As I said, it's really an approach that I think is in its infancy in Wales. So, there is this commitment. I think there's a real drive by a range, particularly, of public sector agencies to understand what this is and to implement it, but there's still a long way to go, I think, in terms of implementing it fully.I wanted to mention as well the serious violence duty. So, this is another legislative driver that we have at the moment to implement a public health approach. The serious violence duty is an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. So, it's central Government legislation, but it puts a responsibility on a range of multi-agency partners to take a public health approach to violence prevention. So, I wanted to mention that, because we have these two drivers, really, for taking a public health approach. They're both relatively new. So, with the serious violence duty, they tend to be regional multi-agency partnerships, which are being set up across Wales, to implement a public health approach. There are two statutory responsibilities: one is to do a strategic needs assessment, and one is to do a strategy. So, I think what will be quite important going forward will be to ensure that, with the commitments of the VAWDASV Act and the commitments of the serious violence duty, we ensure that partners can work together across both of those duties, to ensure there isn't duplication or siloed working, really. So, as I said, quite a long way to go to implement it fully, but we certainly now have some of the drivers to ensure that it can be put into place.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Just very briefly, what's the difference between the serious violence duty and the 'ask and act' that we talk about, colloquially?\n\nLara Snowdon: So, 'ask and act' is particularly a duty on health service professionals to be aware of what VAWDASV is and to understand that they have a role in actively asking the question about the experience of VAWDASV, and then taking responsible and appropriate action if they discover that somebody has experienced VAWDASV. The serious violence duty is a piece of legislation that is on organisations to collaborate to take a public health preventative approach to what's termed as serious violence\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, you're saying that 'ask and act' only applies to the health service, not to the education service, the housing service, or anything else?\n\nLara Snowdon: Sorry, it's because I'm from public health, so particularly in my sphere of work we're working to ensure that it's implemented across health, but there's a wider multi-agency responsibility on 'ask and act'.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Just to put some slightly counter views to you: Dr Burrell, of Durham University, supports the public health approach, but says that the gendered roots of violence against women and girls must remain front and centre. Is that something you agree with, or do you think that we need to change the emphasis?\n\nLara Snowdon: No, I absolutely agree with Dr Burrell, and very much respect Dr Burrell, particularly in his role in engaging men and boys in the prevention of gender-based violence. In terms of gender-based violence, really, the clue is in the title\u2014it's where gender is recognised as a causal factor in what causes that violence to take place. So, we can understand gender as a causal factor, but then intersect it by other risk and protective factors, which may increase or decrease the risk of VAWDASV taking place. So, we quite often would describe gender as a cause and a consequence\u2014. Sorry, we would quite often understand gender-based violence as a cause and a consequence of gender inequality. So, gender inequality underpins gender-based violence, but it also reproduces it as well. It's really important to understand this, because this tells us a lot about what the preventative measures are.So, again, through a public health approach, we would talk about modifiable risk factors; so, these are factors that can be changed, which is the key part of how preventative programmes are developed. We know that people of the male sex are more likely to perpetrate violence, as well as gender-based violence, but we also know that particular kinds of social norms are harmful\u2014so, those that are rooted in patriarchal norms, misogyny, sexism\u2014and we know that those social norms can lead to violence. So, through the VAWDASV literature review, we really found that programmes that sought to transform those harmful gender norms, and to work alongside men and boys, to really critically think about what those social norms look like, and then how they can engage in them, to change them among their peer group, really, is a really important thing that we can do for the prevention of gender-based violence.I think the only other thing really to say on this is around intersectionality. So, whilst we have to remember that gender is front and centre, gender is intersected by other intersections, I guess, of social categories. So, that could be something like socioeconomic deprivation, or race, or sexuality, or religion, and some of these things can make women and girls, in particular, more at risk of experiencing gender-based violence. It could also change the nature of the violence that is experienced as well as the response that they get from the services that they try to access. So, sorry, a slightly long answer there, but we can certainly understand gender as a causal risk factor, which is intersected by other factors as well.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. I agree that this is not <em>Daily Mail</em> stuff. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Just finally from me, could you tell me how well you think the VAWDASV strategy understands the complexity of reaching different diverse communities, such as those you've outlined, so that we're confident that it's going to reach all women and girls, and indeed, men and boys?\n\nLara Snowdon: Again, I think, really, I have the same answer in the sense that it's fantastic that intersectionality is recognised in the VAWDASV strategy, but again, I think there is a long way to go to ensure that the diversity that we have in communities in Wales is represented in VAWDASV prevention and response. So, some examples that we know of research that has been conducted in Wales, such as the 'Uncharted Territory Review', which explored the experiences of women and girls who are migrants, asylum seekers or refugees, wasn't included in the VAWDASV strategy, for example. So, we know that there's a lot of research going on, we know that there's a lot more to do, but having, as a principle, intersectionality, and particularly understanding how prevention programming can intersect with the needs of diverse communities, is going to be really important going forward.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. I'll now ask Sarah Murphy to come in.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much for being here with us this morning. I'm going to ask some questions now about evidence and data. Public Health Wales's systematic review of what works in preventing VAWDASV was published in September 2021. The national advisers for VAWDASV say that the Public Health Wales review has not yet been included in the Welsh Government's VAWDASV strategy. Do you know what the reasons for this are, please?\n\nLara Snowdon: Unfortunately, I don't think I can answer your question directly, because that would be a question for Welsh Government. I do\u2014\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Okay. If I phrase it differently then: do you think that there is sufficient transparency and accountability in the delivery of the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint?\n\nLara Snowdon: Yes. Again, really, this is in the very early stages of implementation; the governance around the blueprint has only recently been established. So, I think we will be looking to see, over the next year or so, how this is implemented. The high-level work plans for the blueprint are now just being published, I believe. I've had assurance that prevention has been included, but I haven't yet seen the detail of that, unfortunately. So, unfortunately, I think it's a bit too early to be really looking at that, but I want to say to Welsh Government colleagues, 'Please do reach out and talk to us about how we can ensure that the blueprint plans are as evidence-based and as theory-based as possible.' We do have this fantastic resource of the VAWDASV systematic review that we can draw upon; there's a lot of evidence in there about what works. Where there are gaps, we need to really understand how we can take a co-ordinated response to research and evaluation for gender-based violence prevention. So, I'm really looking forward to working with colleagues on taking that forward.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much. Can I ask why the systematic review covered primary and secondary interventions, but not tertiary prevention? And, what are the benefits of developing multi-agency data on gender-based violence to measure the prevalence and trends and to monitor inequalities and track progress in prevention? How feasible do you think it is for it to be able to cover all of this?\n\nLara Snowdon: To answer the first part of your question, we focused on primary and secondary prevention because, really, they are areas of both research and practice that are generally under-represented, so I really welcome the committee focusing on this as part of the inquiry. There is really a wealth of evidence around tertiary prevention in comparison to primary and secondary prevention, which is why we decided to focus on this.&nbsp;In addition, it would be absolutely huge if you focused on all three areas. So, that was the reason to focus on that, as well as to meet the commitments in the VAWDASV Act around prevention.&nbsp;On the second part of your question, around data, I think this answers your former question as well, in a sense, because one of the commitments of the VAWDASV Act is to develop a set of national indicators to measure progress around VAWDASV prevention. That is going to be the kind of key thing that we can do to understand whether the strategy and whether the blueprint approach are being effective, essentially. I know that some work has started on the national indicators, but, again, I think this is going to be really critical to ensure that we're understanding that population-level change towards VAWDASV prevention. It really needs to be underpinned by a robust theory of change that is based on evidence and based on a principle to evaluate all of the blueprint activity to ensure that the indicators match the theory of change. So, I think that will be really key to holding partners to account, but also to ensuring that overall governance, really, for the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you. My last question, then, and you've already touched on this a bit. We've heard that the current 'ask and act' duty doesn't empower professionals to act, often because they are unsure about how to handle a disclosure and the responsibility that they will have as individuals for managing the risk. Do you have details of any reviews into how effectively legislative duties such as the 'ask and act' duty are being delivered, please?\n\n"}

I'd like to welcome and introduce our witnesses who've joined us this morning. We have Sarah Thomas, director, The Fostering Network Wales, Elizabeth Bryan, head of operations, The Fostering Network Wales, Matt Lewis, therapeutic fostering services manager Wales, Action for Children, Rhian Carter, team manager, Action for Children, and Mike Anthony, manager for TACT Cymru. You're all very welcome.Members have a number of questions to put to you this morning. I realise there's lots to say, but if somebody has said something, I'd encourage you not to repeat it because I just want to make sure everybody gets through questions. I'd like to remind Members to perhaps be as brief as possible in their questioning. So, we'll start off with questions from Buffy Williams. Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you for joining us this morning. How would you describe the situation of foster placements in Wales? For example, are enough of the right types of placements in the right geographical locations?\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Who wants to start?&nbsp;\n\nSarah Thomas: I'll start.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Thank you, Sarah.&nbsp;\n\nSarah Thomas: I'd say that we do not have enough placements, full stop. We do not have a foster carer for every child who needs them, and they're certainly not living in the location that the child needs them to live in. Some of the barriers that we have to placing children locally is the way that we have a current marketplace, which means that foster carers are free to foster with whom they choose, and that's a very good thing for lots of foster carers, but if we don't utilise and access them in the same way that a local authority can access their foster carers, then we prevent children from being placed within their own locality. The children who are most likely to remain in school, to remain able to attend their clubs and activities and to have a thriving opportunity are the ones who have a foster placement as close to their home location as possible, when it's safe to do so. Local authorities will know all of their foster carers within their LA, and they need to improve, I believe, in the way that they utilise each other and also the systems that are in place to utilise those providers who are external and may have a foster carer right on the front door of where that child needs it, but they can't access it as easily because of the systems and structures we have in place.&nbsp;\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Is there anybody else? Matt.&nbsp;\n\nMatt Lewis: No, we certainly don't echo Sarah's point on that. My view is that we will never have enough suitable families for the number of children because of the framework we're working under, which is actually part of the problem at the moment. So, I think, in terms of radical reform, it's urgently needed of the entire system. Fostering for the foster parents is really complex and challenging. They lack support. They're under a huge amount of scrutiny from the child protection framework and the regulations. So, it is a very difficult place at the moment.&nbsp;The other problem we have is that the poverty, the trauma in our communities, is very serious. The children who come in from the referrals to our service are the worst we've ever seen. Children are routinely not being fed, starved, dehydrated, locked in cupboards, with serious sexual abuse. So, these children need support in their communities to stop the flow-through into care, and the foster families need a different type of recognition and different frameworks for support.\n\nMike Anthony: I'd also add as well that, in some ways, we've always had that problem, and, ever since I've been in social work and fostering, we've had problems recruiting foster carers. But I think it's even worse now, exacerbated by things post pandemic. The sorts of people that we are looking for, traditionally, are people who've got a spare room\u2014financial, cost-of-living crisis, all those things have come together as well. So, we're actually losing some of the people that we would've traditionally perhaps been able to access as well, so there are additional pressures. And we're also finding single foster carers are struggling within the current climate as well, because it is one of those roles that people have to make a big decision about, whether they can afford to foster, and the climate at the moment is super challenging.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Buffy.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you. Can you tell us about the main challenges facing fostering in Wales at the moment, and what are the key priorities to address them?\n\nSarah Thomas: Yes, go for it.\n\nMatt Lewis: The main challenges are that the children are coming in with undiagnosed but very recognisable lifelong conditions such as complex post-traumatic stress, which is created by the birth family members who have terrorised their children and severely hurt the children. They're also severely neglected, and that neglect creates a lifelong learning difficulty. So, the kind of expectations are that these children will develop mental progress if you put them in the right place that's alongside other children, and the fact of the matter is, simply, the outcomes tell us that that's not true. I think of our service\u2014people who've been doing it a long time\u2014and we do everything we can to support the children, but managing their environments and keeping it safe, calm, playful, taking them back to early years experience, and keeping the anxiety at bay is the best chance that we have to help them.We also think much more like an adoptive service than a fostering service. So, success for us is that our children stay with our families for the rest of their lives; they're not encouraged to move out when they're 16, as they currently are. We know that children leaving care at 16 or 18 are likely to have their own children and then begins the cycle again, which leads to more potential removals of children. So, fostering should be viewed as a permanent option. It should be a family like any other. We don't use the word 'placement', because the children get very confused by it. So, there's a huge amount of challenge, but that would be where I would start at the moment\u2014recognising that children need far more support across a life journey than they're currently getting.\n\nSarah Thomas: I think I would add, on that note, really, stability is the greatest challenge that we face for our young people. We are currently unable to ensure that, when we remove them from their family, where we take away the people who were meant to fight for them and protect them\u2014. We do that and then we fail to offer an alternative that is better than that on lots of occasions, because we're unable to create that permanency, to ensure the best possible match, because of the lack of provision that we have within the fostering sector. And then, on top of that, we don't necessarily structure our services in the way that they are driven to meet the needs of the child. At the moment, our services are meeting the needs of those who work within them, or meeting the financial pressures, rather than focusing on\u2014. It feels to me like we've sort of lost track of what good outcomes are and what it is that we're all here to do, and what we're striving to achieve seems to have become slightly diluted in the fact that our services aren't able to do what many of them would like to do.\n\nMike Anthony: And I think some of that has been impacted hugely by the social work crisis as well in staffing. We're dealing with many foster placements where the turnover of social workers\u2014. There are massive delays, as Matt was describing, and a complexity of what we're dealing with with the needs of the children, and there's a real inconsistency quite often, or changes in social workers, and some of the teams are running at 30 per cent social work and carrying vacancies or agency staff. One of the good things about being in fostering, as an agency for a long time, as well, is that there's continuity in our fostering teams, but in the social work teams the churn is enormous, and that has massive implications for the services that you get. Delays in therapy: we might have a referral going to therapy, the social worker changes, the team leader changes, and you're knocked back in the work that's going on. So, I think the current crisis in social work is enormous as well.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth Bryan: Yes, for the child to have an adult who knows them well making a decision for them, I think some of them probably feel that that isn't the case because there hasn't been a consistency for them. And then, when they make their own decisions\u2014. I think we spoke earlier this morning in our event about how they're expected to make a lot of big decisions by themselves when they're 18, but they've not been supported to do that; it's not scaffolded through their life because there isn't that consistency from a trusted adult. I think that's really key.\n\nMike Anthony: I think it actually does the opposite as well, doesn't it? In some cases, it's actually teaching some of our children and young people not to trust or invest in some of the adults that are working with them. So, it's a by-product of that, which is absolutely the opposite of what we're trying to achieve.\n\nRhian Carter: We also find there's poor provision. So, a lot of our children struggle in mainstream school, and even the specialist provisions are not fit for what the children need. In terms of the trauma, we find the children just can't cope with an education environment, and they really, really struggle. Family contact is also a huge issue. You're sending a child to see their abuser. So, it often retraumatises the children, and the lead-up to contact and after contact can be horrendous for our children in terms of bed-wetting, soiling. It sends them backwards, really, so they're not able to have that safe time away from their perpetrators.\n\nMatt Lewis: Rhian's right. There are two things that we've identified that break down long-term foster families, and that is the wrong education provision because the children simply do not function at their chronological age in the way that mainstream education thinks they do. So, at 18, the children are much more like four years of age in the emotional developmental stage\u2014they still can't do friendships, can't manage relationships, or money, for example. The other thing is that the children have been highly terrorised and traumatised by birth families, and when we show them the perpetrators of their abuse, our current framework suggests that that's a good thing, but if you look at the underlying neurological, psychological impact on the child, it pulls them back into that abusive system. So, we create on our own\u2014. We've got a clinical issue in terms of the way in which the brain is affected by neurology that isn't recognised by the welfare and the rights-based system that we currently work within.\n\nRhian Carter: And also life story work. Children often have this piece of work done, often sharing information they never knew about or can't remember, and then they're planting memories and stories into their brains that they just cannot cope with\u2014\n\nMatt Lewis: They can't process it.\n\nRhian Carter: \u2014and they just can't process.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Just one more quick question, Chair\u2014\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Yes, absolutely.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: \u2014maybe to Matt. You spoke about children who have been seriously sexually abused, exploited and terrorised. Is there enough expert care\u2014quality expert care\u2014out there to support these children within the care sector?\n\nMatt Lewis: I think, unfortunately\u2014. I've been working in these services a long time\u2014youth justice Merthyr and children with disabilities. There's a kind of myth\u2014a hopeful myth\u2014of recovery; we kind of hope that people will get better. Now, we know, as adults, if any of us have had some difficulty, we're always managing that difficulty. But, what we've got with our children are very, very serious developmental issues and traumatic problems that the system currently doesn't recognise; it's not making connections between them as victims of very serious perpetrators and what that means for lifelong belonging, if that's the only family you're allowed to belong in. I don't think the current system thinks clinically deep enough about the state in which children come out of what are very dangerous family settings. So, the short answer is 'no', unfortunately. There's simply not enough expertise.\n\nMike Anthony: I think, even when there is the expertise, sometimes you're trying to get to that, and sometimes the waiting lists are so long in child and adolescent mental health services. It's a pretty broken system, I think. That's why sometimes, like in our own lives, we have to sometimes bypass that, and parents will look to get their own services bought in or whatever. I think, with placements, sometimes, we're seeing placements break down, and not just placements break down, but we're seeing foster carers dealing with highly traumatised children, not getting the services the children need, and then we're seeing breakdowns in placements and losing foster carers because it can be such a difficult and impactful experience, managing such traumatised children.\n\nBuffy Williams MS: Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Thanks, Buffy. A question now from James Evans. James.&nbsp;\n\nJames Evans MS: You're never quite sure here who's going to mute you or unmute you, sometimes. I am looking at my other screen, I am Chair, because I can't look at the small screen, my eyes go funny. Thank you.&nbsp;We've heard of the huge disruption and upset that children and young people experience when they have to move from placement to placement, especially at short notice, after the trauma of being removed from their birth family. Statistics do show that more than a quarter of children have had two or more placements in the last 12 months alone. Why are there so many placement moves and, to what extent is this because of a child's own needs, as opposed to it being because the placement is needed for another child coming into the system? I can't see any of you, so you'll have to jump in as and when. Chair, I'll have to hand over to you to bring people in, because I can't see you.&nbsp;\n\nJayne Bryant AM: That's no problem.

Justice transformation programme"], "answer": "D", "content": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: So, as we don't have any apologies, we can move directly to item No. 2 on the agenda. It's our first substantive item here, and it is the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, particularly focusing on spending in relation to justice, and general scrutiny as well. So, we have with us\u2014delighted to see you here again\u2014Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution, thank you for joining us, and alongside you, we have James Gerard, the deputy director of justice policy, Welsh Government; Sophie Brighouse, deputy director, constitution and Welsh tribunals, Welsh Government; and Dr Robert Parry, deputy director, European transition, Welsh Government. So, welcome to you all.We'll try and keep this as free-flowing as possible, and Counsel General, if you want to bring in your colleagues or if they want to contribute, feel free. We've got quite a lot to cover there, so we'll see how far we go. Now, I'm just going to do, as per normal with the Chair, a broad opener, and then I'm going to turn to my colleagues to come in with some forensic analysis of where we are on justice and the budget. So, one of the things we're aware of is that there are pressures on the resources available to Welsh Government, so we'd like to ask to which areas you've given prioritisation within the budget, and which ones have duly been deprioritised in the field of justice within the draft budget. Counsel General.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Thank you for the question, and of course, you'll appreciate it's an incredibly difficult environment financially. The Welsh Government's budget overall has been impacted not only by long periods of austerity up till now, but potentially also significant impacts because of inflation, and of course, the estimate is over the next couple of years that there is a loss in real terms of about \u00a33 billion in terms of the Welsh Government's budget.Can I also say that in terms of the budget with regard to justice, of course, I don't have, in that sense, a specific budget per se? Because my function as Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution, of course, overlaps into, really, all the other portfolio areas that are impacted by justice, and in particular, the Minister for Social Justice and many of the justice elements that are made up are actually within Jane Hutt's ministerial portfolio. So, whereas I have a sort of engagement and, of course, work very closely with the Minister for Social Justice, the budget I have is, or the areas that I work in predominantly relate to, I think, what are staffing costs and some research and policy development areas. So, there'll be areas where it's probably difficult for me to talk about, because they're questions that probably should be going to specific Ministers, but in general, we have tried to and we've kept, I think, the core budgets for justice, for social justice as well. The areas in terms of the Thomas commission, for example, the justice transformation programme, are, I think, slightly down on previous years, but have essentially been maintained. Some of the important areas\u2014for example, single advice, and so on, and community support\u2014have been retained.There has been, as you know, a Government overview of reprioritisation because of the particular circumstances we're in, and there are three priorities that have been set. One is protecting public services, the other is protecting those who are feeling most acutely the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, and the third is supporting business through, really, recessionary times. So, that is where the focus of Welsh Government is in terms of maximising the best use of it.But in terms of the justice elements, I think those have essentially been retained. I don't see any major impact in terms of us being able to continue what we are doing. I would love it if there was more money to be able to look at additional things we could do or how we could do things better, and it may be that there are some things that we end up doing more slowly, for example, or we can't do as much of as we wanted to, but, essentially, we've retained the core elements of the justice budget.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Counsel General. Peredur, before I bring you in, can I just\u2014Alun, you wanted to come in on this.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Yes. I'm grateful to the Counsel General for that introduction. You say you've retained the core elements of the justice portfolio, and, of course, one of your roles, as you say, is to take an overview of different matters, rather than be a delivery Minister in the way that Jane Hutt would be, in the way that you've described. One of those core elements, of course, is the provision of legal support to Ministers, and one of the things we've heard throughout this Senedd, actually, has been that Ministers don't have sufficient resources to legislate and so they need to use the legislative consent motion process. So, I was wondering if you felt now, with this budget, that you have sufficient resources to ensure that Ministers will have those resources in place where they need to legislate.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: What we do have\u2014. I think perhaps I'd turn the question round a bit in answering it\u2014\n\nAlun Davies AM: It's all right. I'm quite happy with the question I asked.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Well, no, I have to answer it by saying what we have is we have the budget that is set in terms of the functions that we have. Where the challenges come might be, for example, in the area of retained EU law. We're not quite sure precisely what that is going to mean and what the implications of that are going to be. The other thing, of course, is that much of it is actually staff and lawyer time, et cetera, looking at UK Government Bills as one element, and if those change or those increase, or new Bills are introduced\u2014we now have, for example, the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill coming through, which raises all sorts of issues in respect of Welsh Government responsibilities. So, those are all things that are new that come in that then have to be accommodated, and they will be accommodated, as we will do with the retained EU law, it's just it's difficult to be precise about it, because you're budgeting for what you expect to be there, and you don't have an enormous amount of leeway within that.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Counsel General, I understand completely that when you've got a chaotic situation in London all sorts of different things can happen, and retained EU law is an example of a chaotic process. I accept that, and I accept that you can't budget against that process. I understand that. But do you accept or do you believe that the resources that have been placed within the different departments to support and to sustain that department's legislative programme are sufficient to meet their needs?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Yes, I do, and I believe we will deliver on that legislative programme.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Okay. That's fine.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That's good to hear. Thanks, Alun. Peredur, over to you. We're going to delve deeper now into justice and the draft budget.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Counsel General, you talked there about protecting the core functions, which suggests there are non-core elements, so they will be negatively impacted by reducing budgets. Could you give us an outline of what's been deprioritised?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: There is nothing that we have deprioritised. There are things that we have worked to retain, and we've retained by keeping budgets at the same as what we planned to do, but what we haven't been able to do is, of course, to take into account what the impact of, for example, inflation might be, the fact of the reduction in the value of the budgets that we actually have. So, that doesn't mean that we're not going to deliver, but, undoubtedly, it may well impact in terms of how quickly we deliver or the extent to which we deliver, and that is a little bit that's unknown until you are into it.For example, the single advice fund, we've protected. That's \u00a311 million, and that was introduced and was increased in past years to make up for the impact of UK Government cuts in legal aid. There is never enough money. I've got a feeling in the cost-of-living crisis, et cetera, there are so many things we might want to do, so many things we might want to expand, but we have to work within that budget and within the value of that. So, it's more a question of we're continuing to do what we've planned to do, but how far that money goes in being able to complete that remains uncertain at this stage.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: In your discussions\u2014you've talked about the social justice Minister\u2014what sort of evidence and data have you been using to come to budget-making decisions and some of those things that you were talking about there?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Really, the data is, for example, the past performance. For example, if I take the single advice fund again as an example, we know how many cases there are that we've had in, we know how much money's been recovered, we know what the scale of the debt problem has been. What we don't know and what we have to continue to monitor is the extent to which that is going to escalate. That is unpredictable. I think certainly it will increase. I think the strains in terms of being able to deliver as much as we want to are going to be very, very difficult in the forthcoming year. That is one example.&nbsp;Another example might be, for example, in terms of tribunals. The tribunals operate independently. They're part of the judicial system. There is a very slight reduction in the budget there. The tribunals came under budget during the last financial year, partly because of more online hearings rather than face-to-face hearings. That may change. There may, of course, be more cases. That part of the justice system has to be able to deliver. It's one of those things where you have to monitor as you go along to ensure, but the fact of the matter is that it has to be delivered. We do have to have those cases. They have to operate and they have to operate within the correct judicial environment, and independently of Government, et cetera. We think the budget will manage that, but it's one of those things where we have to be ongoing in monitoring it. That is clearly a priority area as well.It's the same with the funding that's been available\u2014again, it's not my budget\u2014in terms of the police community support officers, and so on. They are there. That is set. That funding is absolutely committed. But, of course, there are imponderables that may impact on these things, like wage issues and so on. At the moment, those budgets are there, those things have been prioritised. We're retaining nearly all the key justice elements. When I say 'core', I think core in terms of what we're doing at the moment. The challenge will be all those additional things that might impact upon us over the coming year that are unpredictable at this stage. That's why we have to keep a very close eye and monitor the development of those particular justice services.&nbsp;\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: Those services and the impact on your three elements\u2014the most vulnerable and the cost-of-living crisis\u2014what do you foresee is the impact on the tribunals, on PCSOs? In real terms, it's a cut because of the inflationary pressure. So, in terms of numbers of hours or people on the ground, that sort of thing, what is the actual impact to people in our communities?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: At the moment, there is no impact, in the sense that we will continue to support the numbers that we have. The impact on communities may well be coming in the extent to which we can manage and cope with the scale of demand, for example, for single advice that's required. The pressures that may come will be where there are additional cost elements to be added on that are unpredictable at this stage, and so on. So, the answer is that we're moving into an area of a degree of uncertainty about what the full impact is going to be. It's one of those things you have to monitor.But, I do have to stress again that these are budgets in other people's portfolios. These are not my portfolios. I engage in the broader sense on these. I know because I chair the justice Cabinet sub-committee that we do take a look at the overall picture in terms of the developments, what is happening in social justice, what are all the projects that are there. In that committee, we don't go into the budgets; those are left to the individual portfolios. And of course, you'll notice that some of those budgets go into health, they go into social services and local government issues, they go into education as well. So, in many ways, the specific budgets there are ones where I can talk generally about them, but I think any detail on them you probably need to put to the specific Ministers in terms of their portfolios.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: And finally from me for the moment, you've talked about the conversations you've had, you've talked about the budget and protecting some of that core funding and core elements, but what's been the hardest decision you've had to make?&nbsp;\n\nMick Antoniw AM: I don't think the hardest decision we've had to make has yet potentially materialised. I think the decisions may well come depending upon what the future pressures might be. I think, because of the approach the Welsh Government has adopted in terms of the importance of the impact it's having on people going through these particularly difficult times, the social justice elements in particular are the ones that have been very much supported and haven't been impacted, other than that they may be impacted if costs and things like that rise, and if inflation impacts on the scale of it. At the moment, I don't think there are major hard decisions that I've had to take, or that other Ministers have had to take, but that will be for them to consider in due course.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: So you haven't had to make any hard decisions yet.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Not yet, but I've got a feeling that the next year is going to involve lots of hard decisions.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thanks, Peredur. Before I bring Alun in, Minister, one of the areas that is covered by your portfolio is the work that's ongoing with the Welsh Government justice transformation programme, formerly the justice commission in Wales, and so on, which includes, of course, the aspects of taking forward the Welsh Government's proposals on devolution of justice. It's small, but it is one of the areas where there is a decrease within budget allocations within the draft budget for the year ahead. Should we take this as a signal of something? Do we take from this that this is lower down the priority ranking, at least for the foreseeable future, and what does it mean for post 2024?&nbsp;\n\n"}

Are all Members content? Thank you. Well, I note I believe that all Members are content. The clerk, therefore, will now change the settings from public to private, and we will then continue with the meeting.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Bore da. Croeso. Good morning and welcome back to the Public Accounts and Public Administration Committee, meeting this morning remotely. I welcome our guests who'll be giving evidence to committee. I'd be grateful if you could state your names and roles for the record, perhaps starting with Mr Prentice.\n\nPhil Prentice: Hello. My name's Phil Prentice, I'm the chief officer of Scotland's Towns Partnership and the national programme director for Scotland's Improvement Districts.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you very much. And, Mr Roe.\n\nRichard Roe: Good morning, everyone. My name's Richard Roe, I am the corporate director for place at Trafford Council.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you very much indeed. Actually, you're not very far from where I'm sitting at the moment, ironically, albeit across that incredible border.As you'd expect, we have a number of questions, and I would ask both Members and witnesses to be as succinct as possible so that we can cover as wide a range of issues as possible generated by this topic. I will start with the questions to the witnesses. I'll start by asking you to what extent you believe that local authorities in your own jurisdictions are able to effectively create local coalitions of change and bring together all the key players to help regenerate and improve towns. I don't know which of you would like to go first.\n\nPhil Prentice: I'm happy to go first, Mark. I think it's a mixed picture across the country. Some local authorities are very good at this, others less so. So, there genuinely isn't consistency across the piece. But, I would say that, where we see success, it's where local government works very positively with its community and business partnerships and there's trust and an understanding of roles and remits. No one sector is going to be able to fix this problem on its own, and I think there has to be a growing recognition that we do need much more collaboration, but it is a mixed picture.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Would Richard Roe like to comment?\n\nRichard Roe: Yes. I agree with Phil. I think I would say it's a mixed picture. But, if it's going to work, if you're going to successfully regenerate town centres, then it needs the local authority to lead. We are the key player in that role, but the local authority can't do it on its own. So, you do need a coalition with business, with community, with other public sector partners. That's certainly our experience. I think the private sector wants the local authority to step into that space, they want the local authority to take the lead, they want the local authority to create the right environment for investment, and then they will follow. I think the community is the same. I think that has to be the approach. I think, as Phil said, the appetite in different local authorities may not be there.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In the evidence we've received thus far, we've seen local authorities taking the leadership in some towns, but we've also seen town councils, for example, different tiers of local government, taking the lead in other areas, which goes back to the words you referred to in terms of working together and collaboration and partnership. To what extent, from your experience, have you seen local authorities having the right skills with their lead partners in terms of leadership, resources, buy-in and capacity to regenerate towns in the areas where you're working?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll go first, if you don't mind. Again, it's a similar picture. I think local authorities have suffered disproportionately in terms of development departments\u2014economic, housing\u2014through the period of austerity over the last 12 to 15 years. Usually, it's these functions that will have been depleted. That said, I think there's an opportunity here for a regional approach, whereby a lot of those skill sets could be shared across a number of local authorities. In Scotland, we've got a unitary system of 32. We don't have to have specialists in 32 local authorities on housing or finance or net zero; you could actually be doing that at a regional level and driving efficiency. So, we're seeing much more of that through the city and regional growth deals and the regional economic partnerships, particularly in the south of Scotland where we've got a new enterprise agency. They've taken a much more clearly defined role in leading on town-centre regeneration and working more closely with the local authority. So, they're actually bringing the capacity into local government for that period of time, and additional resources, skills and so on. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about structure, so long as the activity is being delivered. But we are facing difficult times around resourcing, so I think there must be more collaboration and a regional approach taken.\n\nRichard Roe: I think there is, undoubtedly, a capacity challenge and a financial challenge, but some of this comes down to prioritisation and the extent to which the authority puts town-centre regeneration as being a priority, and therefore puts resources behind that. I do think there's an opportunity for collaboration. Certainly, within greater Manchester, we do that across the 10 districts and with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, on the basis that that gives us collectively more scope, more buying power. I think there is also scope if you're going to do it with a public, private or community sector partnership, to bring in some of those resources from outside. It doesn't mean the authority has to do everything itself; you can tap into and bring in private sector resources to add in, and that's certainly something that we try and do and push as much as we can.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Have you witnessed or seen any pushback from, say, senior people who don't want to share power in practice, and want to be in charge and carry on in the old way? How's that being managed to get them on board?\n\nRichard Roe: I think there's always some pushback. There are always little power bases. I think the starting point is to get the shared vision. So, certainly, our approach in our town centre\u2014so, in Altrincham and now in Stretford\u2014has been working to get a shared vision, shared ambition, and once you've got that, you've got something you can align behind and that becomes the priority. But that's the starting point.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In terms of the planning system, again, to what extent in your experience do you believe this has been flexible enough to support businesses and partners to respond quickly to problems when they arise, and, if it hasn't, what should be done to improve this? Of course, I'm aware\u2014as obviously, clearly you are\u2014the planning systems in Scotland, Wales and England are not completely aligned, but nonetheless similar issues apply.\n\nPhil Prentice: Again, I'll pitch in from Scotland. We have just published 'National Planning Framework 4', so the new national plan framework has just been approved by the Scottish Parliament. That was actually quite timely because we'd already begun to understand the ongoing trends around it, the decline in retail, and how citizen behaviour had changed, and the urgency around climate. So, a lot of the new policies point towards that. We also have a town-centre policy now called 'A New Future for Scotland's Town Centres', and things that will actually reduce our carbon footprint, that will put more energy back into our town centres, particularly by repopulating and driving residential solutions. So, the planning system, I think, that we have is fit for purpose, and certainly over the last few months, some of the early tests around out-of-town sprawl development have actually been called in by the Scottish Government, and the applications have been refused.So, I think it's important that the Welsh Government gets its story straight, and that there is an alignment within the Welsh Government to make sure there's a consistent approach, because at the end of the day, the planning framework should really encourage the right sort of investment, and we should only be funding the right sort of investment. So, if you get your story straight to begin with, most of the jigsaw pieces will then ultimately fall into place. And all commercial investors want to see is consistency and longevity. They want to know that this is the way it's going to be long term, and the money will then follow up after that. So, I think we have actually got a pretty decent planning system. Obviously, the proof will be in the pudding and the delivery over the next few years, but at least the policy is very solid.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Mr Roe.&nbsp;\n\nRichard Roe: I think I'm probably slightly less optimistic than Phil on this. I think there are some challenges in the planning system. I think it can be slow to get policy changes made. Actually, in our full council last night, we adopted a new planning policy, the civic quarter area action plan, just outside one of our town centres, but it's taken us four years to get that adopted, to go through the system that we have to go through. And we've ended up\u2014. We're adopting it in a very different place from when we started. So, I do think there are some challenges in getting policy and being able to move policy quickly enough to respond to a changing economic environment.&nbsp;I think permitted development rights and the conversion of office to residential gives us some challenges as well, in terms of our ability to manage how that transition&nbsp;from commercial to residential is led, not that we're against bringing more residential into the town centre. That's something that we want to do, but we also want to manage how it works from the commercial basis. You're always recognising in the planning system that you're potentially trying to balance out people with very different interests, and that is always one part of the challenge.Having said that, I think that, used properly, there are some advantages and some strengths in the planning system when you look at individual applications. We have got a neighbourhood business plan in Altrincham, which was worked on and led by the local community, owned by the local community, and they're still very involved with the design panel in looking at development within Altrincham town centre. So, used properly, it can be of benefit, but there are some structural challenges, I think.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: And what, in your view, needs to change to address those?\n\nRichard Roe: I think that some of it is a national-level policy change. The nature of planning is that it takes a long time to do. Within greater Manchester, we're working on a regional strategy now, 'Places for Everyone', across nine of the 10 districts. We've been working on that for seven years now, to get that through. That's a long time to get your baseline planning policy in place. These things are complex, they're large, they're difficult, but there's got to be a way for us to get policy decisions made slightly quicker. Because Phil's right\u2014what the private sector and what the community wants is certainty and understanding. And actually, when you're going through the system, creating planning policy, you're putting uncertainty into the system, and always with the danger that there's a change in national policy, which actually then means that the baseline that you should be working against starts to change.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Again, based upon your experiences, what needs to happen to get other public sector partners, for example health trusts, boards, universities, or otherwise, to work with councils to deliver regeneration in towns?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll pitch in. I think, in Scotland, we've taken a very different approach. We haven't looked at it solely through the prism of town centres\u2014we've looked at it through the prism of place. And through that, we developed a place principle, which was co-signed by local government and the Scottish Government and a number of our key agencies\u2014the likes of enterprise agencies, transport, VisitScotland and the third sector. And the rationale behind that was really that place is the responsibility of all actors, and, ultimately, all actors will have a distinct role to play in actually making the place better, making it work better for citizens, ultimately. And that does involve transportation, it involves health, it involves housing, it involves the environment. But I think that having that discussion at the place-based partnership gives us a much better opportunity to create a holistic vision, and to look at how resources are aligned in the longer term. It even considers disinvestments\u2014an honest discussion about what has to go and what's not affordable any more. So, I think, taking a place-based approach has broadened out the discussion, and no longer is town-centre regeneration seen to be solely the remit of local authorities\u2014it's actually seen to be everybody's responsibility. The principle was launched in 2018, so it's still taking time to embed, but most place partnerships now do involve constituent elements of local authorities\u2014usually being the main driver\u2014but other key community planning partners, particularly health, heritage and economy. And that approach genuinely has widened out and improved the approach to places, which, ultimately, has affected a lot of town centres positively. Because, a wee bit like Wales, Scotland is very much a nation of towns, with the exception of a couple of cities. So, it's where the bulk of our population and businesses reside, and we're need to actually grasp that nettle and just work collegiately to make it better.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. And Richard Roe.\n\n"}

I think the private sector wants the local authority to step into that space, they want the local authority to take the lead, they want the local authority to create the right environment for investment, and then they will follow. I think the community is the same. I think that has to be the approach. I think, as Phil said, the appetite in different local authorities may not be there.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In the evidence we've received thus far, we've seen local authorities taking the leadership in some towns, but we've also seen town councils, for example, different tiers of local government, taking the lead in other areas, which goes back to the words you referred to in terms of working together and collaboration and partnership. To what extent, from your experience, have you seen local authorities having the right skills with their lead partners in terms of leadership, resources, buy-in and capacity to regenerate towns in the areas where you're working?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll go first, if you don't mind. Again, it's a similar picture. I think local authorities have suffered disproportionately in terms of development departments\u2014economic, housing\u2014through the period of austerity over the last 12 to 15 years. Usually, it's these functions that will have been depleted. That said, I think there's an opportunity here for a regional approach, whereby a lot of those skill sets could be shared across a number of local authorities. In Scotland, we've got a unitary system of 32. We don't have to have specialists in 32 local authorities on housing or finance or net zero; you could actually be doing that at a regional level and driving efficiency. So, we're seeing much more of that through the city and regional growth deals and the regional economic partnerships, particularly in the south of Scotland where we've got a new enterprise agency. They've taken a much more clearly defined role in leading on town-centre regeneration and working more closely with the local authority. So, they're actually bringing the capacity into local government for that period of time, and additional resources, skills and so on. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about structure, so long as the activity is being delivered. But we are facing difficult times around resourcing, so I think there must be more collaboration and a regional approach taken.\n\nRichard Roe: I think there is, undoubtedly, a capacity challenge and a financial challenge, but some of this comes down to prioritisation and the extent to which the authority puts town-centre regeneration as being a priority, and therefore puts resources behind that. I do think there's an opportunity for collaboration. Certainly, within greater Manchester, we do that across the 10 districts and with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, on the basis that that gives us collectively more scope, more buying power. I think there is also scope if you're going to do it with a public, private or community sector partnership, to bring in some of those resources from outside. It doesn't mean the authority has to do everything itself; you can tap into and bring in private sector resources to add in, and that's certainly something that we try and do and push as much as we can.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Have you witnessed or seen any pushback from, say, senior people who don't want to share power in practice, and want to be in charge and carry on in the old way? How's that being managed to get them on board?\n\nRichard Roe: I think there's always some pushback. There are always little power bases. I think the starting point is to get the shared vision. So, certainly, our approach in our town centre\u2014so, in Altrincham and now in Stretford\u2014has been working to get a shared vision, shared ambition, and once you've got that, you've got something you can align behind and that becomes the priority. But that's the starting point.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. In terms of the planning system, again, to what extent in your experience do you believe this has been flexible enough to support businesses and partners to respond quickly to problems when they arise, and, if it hasn't, what should be done to improve this? Of course, I'm aware\u2014as obviously, clearly you are\u2014the planning systems in Scotland, Wales and England are not completely aligned, but nonetheless similar issues apply.\n\nPhil Prentice: Again, I'll pitch in from Scotland. We have just published 'National Planning Framework 4', so the new national plan framework has just been approved by the Scottish Parliament. That was actually quite timely because we'd already begun to understand the ongoing trends around it, the decline in retail, and how citizen behaviour had changed, and the urgency around climate. So, a lot of the new policies point towards that. We also have a town-centre policy now called 'A New Future for Scotland's Town Centres', and things that will actually reduce our carbon footprint, that will put more energy back into our town centres, particularly by repopulating and driving residential solutions. So, the planning system, I think, that we have is fit for purpose, and certainly over the last few months, some of the early tests around out-of-town sprawl development have actually been called in by the Scottish Government, and the applications have been refused.So, I think it's important that the Welsh Government gets its story straight, and that there is an alignment within the Welsh Government to make sure there's a consistent approach, because at the end of the day, the planning framework should really encourage the right sort of investment, and we should only be funding the right sort of investment. So, if you get your story straight to begin with, most of the jigsaw pieces will then ultimately fall into place. And all commercial investors want to see is consistency and longevity. They want to know that this is the way it's going to be long term, and the money will then follow up after that. So, I think we have actually got a pretty decent planning system. Obviously, the proof will be in the pudding and the delivery over the next few years, but at least the policy is very solid.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Mr Roe.&nbsp;\n\nRichard Roe: I think I'm probably slightly less optimistic than Phil on this. I think there are some challenges in the planning system. I think it can be slow to get policy changes made. Actually, in our full council last night, we adopted a new planning policy, the civic quarter area action plan, just outside one of our town centres, but it's taken us four years to get that adopted, to go through the system that we have to go through. And we've ended up\u2014. We're adopting it in a very different place from when we started. So, I do think there are some challenges in getting policy and being able to move policy quickly enough to respond to a changing economic environment.&nbsp;I think permitted development rights and the conversion of office to residential gives us some challenges as well, in terms of our ability to manage how that transition&nbsp;from commercial to residential is led, not that we're against bringing more residential into the town centre. That's something that we want to do, but we also want to manage how it works from the commercial basis. You're always recognising in the planning system that you're potentially trying to balance out people with very different interests, and that is always one part of the challenge.Having said that, I think that, used properly, there are some advantages and some strengths in the planning system when you look at individual applications. We have got a neighbourhood business plan in Altrincham, which was worked on and led by the local community, owned by the local community, and they're still very involved with the design panel in looking at development within Altrincham town centre. So, used properly, it can be of benefit, but there are some structural challenges, I think.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: And what, in your view, needs to change to address those?\n\nRichard Roe: I think that some of it is a national-level policy change. The nature of planning is that it takes a long time to do. Within greater Manchester, we're working on a regional strategy now, 'Places for Everyone', across nine of the 10 districts. We've been working on that for seven years now, to get that through. That's a long time to get your baseline planning policy in place. These things are complex, they're large, they're difficult, but there's got to be a way for us to get policy decisions made slightly quicker. Because Phil's right\u2014what the private sector and what the community wants is certainty and understanding. And actually, when you're going through the system, creating planning policy, you're putting uncertainty into the system, and always with the danger that there's a change in national policy, which actually then means that the baseline that you should be working against starts to change.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. Again, based upon your experiences, what needs to happen to get other public sector partners, for example health trusts, boards, universities, or otherwise, to work with councils to deliver regeneration in towns?\n\nPhil Prentice: I'll pitch in. I think, in Scotland, we've taken a very different approach. We haven't looked at it solely through the prism of town centres\u2014we've looked at it through the prism of place. And through that, we developed a place principle, which was co-signed by local government and the Scottish Government and a number of our key agencies\u2014the likes of enterprise agencies, transport, VisitScotland and the third sector. And the rationale behind that was really that place is the responsibility of all actors, and, ultimately, all actors will have a distinct role to play in actually making the place better, making it work better for citizens, ultimately. And that does involve transportation, it involves health, it involves housing, it involves the environment. But I think that having that discussion at the place-based partnership gives us a much better opportunity to create a holistic vision, and to look at how resources are aligned in the longer term. It even considers disinvestments\u2014an honest discussion about what has to go and what's not affordable any more. So, I think, taking a place-based approach has broadened out the discussion, and no longer is town-centre regeneration seen to be solely the remit of local authorities\u2014it's actually seen to be everybody's responsibility. The principle was launched in 2018, so it's still taking time to embed, but most place partnerships now do involve constituent elements of local authorities\u2014usually being the main driver\u2014but other key community planning partners, particularly health, heritage and economy. And that approach genuinely has widened out and improved the approach to places, which, ultimately, has affected a lot of town centres positively. Because, a wee bit like Wales, Scotland is very much a nation of towns, with the exception of a couple of cities. So, it's where the bulk of our population and businesses reside, and we're need to actually grasp that nettle and just work collegiately to make it better.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: Thank you. And Richard Roe.\n\n"}

The first item this afternoon will be the emergency question that I have accepted under Standing Order 12.67. The question will be answered by the Minister for Social Justice, and is to be asked by Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: What discussions is the Welsh Government having with South Wales Police regarding riots in Cardiff over the last 24 hours? (EQ0010)\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you for that question. This is a tragic incident. My thoughts are with all affected. While South Wales Police urgently investigate the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. I would call for calm and for people to support the police and other agencies involved in supporting the local community.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Minister, for that response to the original question, and can I endorse the comments that you made about calm, and dealing with the facts that relate to this particularly tragic incident? And our thoughts and prayers are, obviously, with the family of the two individuals, as I understand it, who sadly have lost their lives in a road traffic accident.&nbsp;There can be no excuse for the violence we witnessed last night on our tv screens and social media output, but what I would ask of the Welsh Government is: what assessment has been made by the Welsh Government, along with its partner agencies, of the strength of community cohesion in the area of Ely in Cardiff, and in particular the ability of those agencies to respond and work positively and proactively with the community to build the opportunities, install hope in communities, and ultimately make sure that residents in this part of Cardiff do not have to tolerate this level of lawlessness? And will you support me in wishing that the agencies of the law bring forward anyone they can identify, so that the full force of the law can be brought against them to make sure that there is no repetition of these scenes that we saw on our screens last night?\n\nJane Hutt AM: Well, I thank Andrew R.T. Davies for that supplementary question. I was shocked and saddened, as I'm sure we all are today, to hear of the tragic death of two young people involved in a serious road traffic collision in the Ely area of Cardiff yesterday evening, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the two young people involved.&nbsp;But I would like to take the opportunity, along with the points that you've made, to thank all those services, and, indeed, the community itself\u2014all those services involved, of health, police, the local authority, fire and rescue services\u2014for the exemplary way they pulled together to handle the situation. And I think it is a reflection of the excellent community safety partnership work that's been done in that part of Cardiff, focusing on it last night. It enabled those services to work together so well in this fast-moving and tragic situation.&nbsp;I do understand that South Wales Police have made arrests in connection with the disorder, and that more will follow, but, clearly, this is something where our thoughts are also with the community\u2014such a warm and strong community. And I know, obviously, that the local authority, our colleagues and elected representatives, and the leader of the council, were all engaged in this. And I was listening to the phone-in with Jason Mohammed\u2014of course, from the Ely area\u2014who actually interviewed the Rev&nbsp;Jan Gould from the Church of the Resurrection. It's a strong community in Ely, and we must remember this as we look to follow up and hear, obviously, what has happened, what the circumstances were surrounding this tragic series of events.&nbsp;\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: May I thank Andrew R.T. Davies for putting in this question, and thank you, Minister, for the response? As you mentioned, there is an ongoing investigation, but may I echo the comments made in terms of sharing our deepest, deepest sympathy with the families of the victims, and their friends, of course, and, as you say, the community? Because it is a community, a very strong community, and I know many people are devastated by what happened last night, and the subsequent violence as well. And people are terrified, saying that they are still worried that this could escalate further. And what I would want to ask is: what discussions have taken place to provide reassurance to those in the community that suffered last night\u2014they were terrified in their homes\u2014and, obviously, to deal with the tragic loss of two young people as well?Can I ask also in terms of what seems to be that breakdown in community police relations as well, in terms of miscommunication? We've heard that there may have been miscommunication on social media that led to this. Well, there was absolutely no communication with me as one of the five Senedd Members for the area, to find out anything about what happened or to provide any reassuring messages, and I've still not received any messages. I think there is a role for us as Senedd Members to play in terms of community cohesion, and I would ask the Welsh Government to ensure that all elected Members receive that assurance from South Wales Police, so that we are able to support that message that you have rightly made in terms of peace for the community, but also support to rebuild.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Heledd Fychan, and thank you for your words of support and sympathy to the families and to all of those who have been affected by this in the community of Ely. I just want to say that I've already met with the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales, Alun Michael, for an update on this incident, and the First Minister has also been briefed. South Wales Police are looking into exactly what happened, the circumstances surrounding this tragic series of events. And, I have to say, it was a fast-moving situation; I think we were only becoming aware, and I know that the local councillors and the police and all the agencies were working to address the situation, as it emerged. Again, I would want to thank those who responded so quickly and speedily to this. In fact, the violent disorder that took place did include attacks on the emergency services, damage to property, causing considerable fear, as you've said, within the community, which is completely unacceptable. So, can I again call for calm and for people to support the police and other services in the work that's being undertaken now? And, of course, in terms of communications, I'm pleased to be responding to this question this afternoon, and we will keep everyone briefed in terms of the ongoing investigation.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Thank you, Minister, for those responses and for taking the question.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: The next item, therefore, will be our usual first item of questions to the First Minister. The first question is from Hefin David.\n\nHefin David AM: 1. Will the First Minister provide an update on Welsh Government support with the cost of school uniform for learners and their families? OQ59582\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the Welsh Government is clear that the cost of school uniform should not be a barrier to learning. Our updated uniform guidance requires schools to prioritise affordability. Funding of \u00a313.6 million has been made available for the school essentials grant for 2023-24 to help reduce concerns around purchase of school uniform and equipment for lower income families.\n\nHefin David AM: Diolch, Prif Weinidog. All of those measures put in by the Welsh Government are very welcome. And in complement to that, in Lansbury Park in Caerphilly, Lisa Watkins runs the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange, whereby people can visit to exchange uniforms, to pick up uniforms, and, the most important thing to know, they're open to everyone\u2014regardless of income, you are welcome to go along and use the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange. I'd like perhaps to invite the Minister for education, Jeremy Miles, to come and visit the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange and come and see what's happening. There are similar groups across Wales. Would the First Minister, therefore, as I welcome the Government's policy, also welcome the work that is being done by Lisa Watkins and the volunteers there in Lansbury Park?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Can I thank Hefin David for that supplementary question, Llywydd, and begin, as I've done before, in thanking him for all the local efforts I know that he makes to promote the help that is available, both from the Welsh Government and also through the fantastic local community effort to which the Member referred? I read with great interest the personal history of Lisa Watkins\u2014how, as a parent, and obliged for other reasons to move from place to place, she found having to replace school uniform every time her children were at a new school a real issue to deal with. And that personal experience motivated her to start up the community interest company that now trades as Caerphilly Uniform Exchange. And the fact that it focuses on recycling school uniforms, both for the cost involved and also because we know that, environmentally, it is far better to be able to reuse and recycle than to buy new each time, is a fantastic service that is being afforded to residents of Hefin David's constituency. As the Member said, Llywydd, these things are replicated elsewhere in other parts of Wales, but I'm sure there's a great deal that can be learned from these local initiatives to make sure that the cost of uniform is never an obstacle to children attending school.\n\n"}

You'll remember that we received evidence from the Minister at the end of the spring term, and we will be hearing from her again at the end of this first stage. But, before us today we have two academics who I'm sure are going to contribute to the scrutiny work, and therefore I welcome Dr Victoria Jenkins, associate professor in law with Swansea University, and Professor Enda Hayes, who is a professor of air quality and carbon management in the University of the West of England. A very warm welcome to you both and thank you for joining us. We'll go straight to questions, and I know that Janet Finch-Saunders wants to ask the first question. Thank you.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, bore da. Is the Bill, as currently drafted, sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in air quality in Wales and soundscapes? And if not, why not?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: Do you want&nbsp;to go first?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: A nice easy question to start. So, air quality and the challenge of dealing with air quality is not new. Since the Environment Act 1995, which is 25 years ago, we've been trying to address this challenge and, to be very honest, we have fundamentally failed. We're very good at diagnosing the problem; we're just not very good at solving it. Now, there are elements of this Bill that I think are going to have a fundamental effect, a positive effect on that challenge. Part of the issues around the Environment Act was the wording of the Act\u2014that you had to work in 'pursuit' of the air quality objectives. We now have got stronger language saying that we have to 'secure' them. So, that's good. Updating of the strategy on a more regular basis, evidence-based targets I think are all really, really positive steps. The bit that worries me is I get a tone from the Bill that we're almost starting from scratch, and we're not. We've got 25-30 years of evidence behind us, which means, I think, we can be a lot more ambitious in terms of the timelines, the targets and how we are going to get there. So, it's Marmite for me at the moment, because there are some bits that I think are really, really good and will solve a lot of the issues and will help us progress in terms of addressing the problems, but it just feels like we can do more.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And we'll come on to some of those individual issues, I'm sure. Dr Jenkins.\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: My interest in this Bill is in relation to how we balance, and my interest generally in terms of environmental law is how we create that balance between giving policy makers and giving Government the discretion to take action to achieve something, but at the same time ensuring accountability. So, that's where I think law may have done us a disservice in the past, and that, moving forward, we need more innovative approaches in that respect. And, from that perspective, I think there are, again, some good bits of this Bill, which are really attempting to put into place a robust framework. I should say I've been an environmental academic lawyer for over 20 years, but I don't specialise in air quality law specifically, so I'm less familiar with the science, but that's why Professor Hayes is here. So, I would say it makes it a little bit trickier for me to talk about the ambition of the Bill in those circumstances, but I'm here to discuss the framework and how it sits today in terms of that balance between discretionary powers and accountability.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Excellent. We will indeed be pursuing some of those points, as well, in a moment, but I'll come to Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I want to go through a specific point right at the outset, which is the scope of the Bill. You touched on the point about starting from scratch. Well, actually, we have various policies in place. One of them is the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013. I declared my interest earlier on there. Now, the active travel group have submitted evidence to this about whether we need to finish some unfinished business that could have been done at the time of the original active travel Act. It's to do with things such as duties to promote active travel, which we've failed to do, et cetera. Now, within the Bill, the Bill addresses two specific, distinct purposes\u2014and my thanks for the briefing note on this\u2014improving air quality, and assessing and managing noise. The cross-party group submission makes the point that Welsh Government state that, in their clean air plan, transport is now the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, predominantly due to emissions from road transport, accounting for approximately one third of emissions, and also, within the explanatory memorandum to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill, it states that our 27 noise maps suggest the homes of more than 200,000 people across Wales are exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organization's 2009 night-noise guidelines, and make the point that the most significant way to deal with this is shifting people away from road use, motorised vehicles, into active travel, walking and cycling, and they suggest some amendments. Have you had time to look at that? Sorry for the extensive preamble, but have you had time to look at that, to express an opinion as to whether you think amendments on active travel would fall within the scope of this Bill? And if you haven't\u2014and I realise you may not\u2014would you be able to go away and have a look at this to see whether you think that those may fall within the scope, because the Llywydd will ultimately have to make a decision on this?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I haven't had a chance to look at it before coming today. I do think that the active travel legislation is significant in the context of air quality and public health, and from my perspective, as an environmental lawyer as well, it's particularly important in bringing together our objectives in Wales in relation to both public health and environmental protection. So, it's certainly, from that perspective, something that I would consider important.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I haven't had a chance to look at it either, but what I would say is that when you're looking at solutions, particularly for transport, active travel is essential. You've got to get to that point. I think, for years, we've been very much orientated in our solutions towards technocentric solutions. So, these are cleaner vehicles, cleaner fuels. That will only get us so far; the scale of the problem here means that we have to look at behavioural interventions, which means getting more people out of vehicles, onto bikes, and out of cars. That's a given. There are a lot of things you have to address to get around that: affordability, accessibility, reliability\u2014all those things that come with public transport\u2014and safety issues around active travel infrastructure, things like that. It's essential. If we're going to solve this problem, then we've got to deal with it.The other point that I might add, if I may, is that what we're dealing with here is a public health issue. It's a public health issue. So, if you're looking at active travel interventions, those interventions will have the core benefits of also working towards better public health. So, it isn't just about improving air quality; it's also the benefits you get elsewhere. So, it's essential, in my mind.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Rather than delay the committee, then, Chair\u2014and thank you for those answers; so, in principle, you've got no objection and, in fact, you can see the benefits of it\u2014I wonder if I could, perhaps, be cheeky enough to ask you to go away and look at it, perhaps discuss it with colleagues in law and whatever to see whether you think it falls within the scope of the two aims of this Bill.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: Okay.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Janet, did you want to come back in on something? And then we'll come back to Huw.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Thank you, Chair. All it was, when we take evidence during the forming of new Bills, quite often, one thing that comes up is that we haven't collected enough data. Now, you say that we look like we're almost at the start again, but a lot of years have gone before. Has the Welsh Government been proactive in collecting the relevant data so that any Bill going forward will be based on really good evidence, if you like?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I can start there. You can always get more data, is the short answer. You can always have more, it can always be better. Across Wales, if we're looking at air quality monitoring data, we've got a pretty extensive network of monitoring sites. I think, from memory, there are about fortyish continuous analysers run by local authorities, and about 10 to 12 analysers connected to the automatic urban and rural network. There's plenty of data already out there. Now, that can always be improved, and I think the tone of the Bill means that we'll have to think differently about how we monitor. So, at the moment, we've monitored for compliance, we've monitored where we've got problematic areas, where we've got these hotspots, where we've got these risks of exceedances. This Bill, again, seems to be more orientated towards prevention, being more proactive\u2014again, the public health side of the issue\u2014which means we have to think differently about how we monitor in terms of understanding public health, and bringing that air quality, health, deprivation triple jeopardy into the equation. So, we've got plenty to start from; we can always have more, and we will have to think differently because the Bill is orientating our approach slightly differently.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Fine.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Let me come on, then, to ask for your views on the Welsh Government's decision, as it stands, to set air quality targets in regulations rather than on the face of the Bill. And their argument is that this will give greater flexibility to respond to the latest guidance and to futureproof the Bill. Do you have sympathy with that or would you prefer to see air quality targets bang on the face of the Bill?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I think this is a question for me in the sense that, if you say too much on the face of primary legislation like this, then you are impinging your discretion to take action as things proceed and as scientific knowledge and understanding moves on. So, it is often a good idea to create a power to introduce regulations. That said, the issue then becomes, well, to what extent do you give the Government discretion, or the Executive discretion, to bring in those regulations and what's the framework for that. So, currently, there is quite a lot of discretion now given to the Executive in that respect, and that's something that you might want to consider further.\n\n"}

I'd like to welcome the Minister for Health and Social Services this morning and her officials. So, perhaps, if I ask officials to introduce themselves for the public record.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMari Williams: Mari Williams, Welsh Government legal services health team.&nbsp;\n\nLeanne Roberts: Morning. I'm Leanne Roberts. I'm the policy lead for healthcare procurement reform.&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Eluned Morgan, health and social services Minister for Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nDafydd Evans: Dafydd Evans, senior responsible officer for the Bill.&nbsp;\n\nNick Lambert: Nick Lambert, Welsh Government legal services, Treasury team.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you very much. Welcome back to some of the panel, who were with us for a technical briefing. We appreciate that, Minister. That was very helpful in our early discussions of the scrutiny process. So, thank you for that. Perhaps I'll ask the Minister: what does the Government want to achieve from this Bill? What's the Government seeking to achieve?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: In order to answer that, if you don't mind, I'll just give a little bit of a background to how we came here, because it is a little bit complicated, and this is not the most exciting Bill you will have had in front of you as a committee. So, what happened is, after we left the European Union, the UK Government said, 'Look, we'll do things differently when it comes to procurement.' And the health team in the UK Government said, 'Oh, well, you know what? We might want to carve ourselves out of whatever you're going to do with the rest of the economy. We want something specific for health, and we want to do things differently for health.' And, as it happens, there was the Health and Care Act 2022 that was going through Parliament. They, therefore, effectively, have written something so that they can have a separate selection regime, so a separate procurement approach from the rest of the economy.Now, because health is devolved, that was effectively an English-only Bill, so they just cracked on with that and didn't actually think about the implications for us, and obviously we live cheek by jowl with the English NHS. They have a huge market, we have 3 million people that we have to service. So, suddenly, we're in a situation where we're going to find ourselves in a different procurement place from England, and there are potential implications for that. So, what we're doing here is we're plugging a gap that has been created by some of the actions that have happened in England, and allowing us the opportunity, should we wish, to align ourselves to the new health procurement regime in England. Now, the problem is they're still going through that process at the moment, so we're not quite sure where it's going to land, in terms of what's going to be covered, but what we want through this Bill is the opportunity and the ability to be able to align, should we wish to do so. I hope that's given a little bit of a background, because it's quite technical, but that's a little bit of the background.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Can I come in straight away, just with a little supplementary? You said that you want to give yourselves an opportunity, as a Government, to align with changes in England. Do you see it exclusively in that way? Or do you see this also as an opportunity to differentiate yourself and head in a different direction, if you so wish, if you're not happy with what you're seeing developing in England?&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, that's an opportunity as well. We're going to have to see what they do and whether we want to follow that. At the moment, we don't know what they're going to put in, so what we didn't want to do was just say, 'Chuck us in that Bill', because we don't know what they're going to come up with. But this will give us the opportunity to follow or not follow, as we see fit.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Okay, thank you.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: What do you see, Minister, as\u2014? What's your vision, I suppose, for health procurement in Wales?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think what's important is to understand that procurement in itself is not what we're about. We're about delivering our vision, which has been set out in 'A Healthier Wales', and what we need in terms of procurement is a system that will enable us to deliver the vision that we've got. What we have been advocating for a while is, perhaps, more collaborative working, making sure we've got high-quality services that are delivered efficiently, that are focused on patient outcomes, but making sure we also have the right checks and balances, which ensures that we spend the little money that we have efficiently on services.\n\nRussell George AM: Quite rightfully, Minister, you talk about patient outcomes, and you said earlier this isn't the most exciting Bill, as well. What would be your advice if I was to get back home this afternoon and a constituent said to me, 'What have you been doing?' I'd say, 'Well, I've been scrutinising this Bill.' How would you explain to your constituent, for example, how this Bill is going to make the health service better for them or the outcomes better for them?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I guess until we see the regulations, it's difficult to say, so let's remember this is what they call a framework Bill. It gives us a holding place where we can then make regulations underneath that, so it gives us the authority and the ability to make rules in future\u2014\n\nRussell George AM: Can you give us an example, perhaps?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Okay. I think what's clear is that there are examples of where there may be barriers to entry for, perhaps, smaller providers, because the procurement rules at the moment could be quite onerous, could be quite high in terms of administrative need. What this will give us an opportunity to do, for example\u2014at the moment, the default position is that everything's got to go through procurement\u2014what this will do for us in future is allow us, for example, the opportunity to roll over contracts that exist already. If they're being well serviced, if we're getting efficiency from the system, we could roll over those contracts. So, that's one thing. It's very difficult to do that now; we have to go through the whole onerous activity. And if, for example, we could see that there was only the possibility of one tender coming up, then we could, perhaps, look at a direct contract being awarded. And then, of course, competition is the third factor. But, at the moment, it's just assumed everything goes out to competition. So, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in future that should save, or could potentially save on some administrative work. I don't know if Dafydd would like to expand on that.\n\nDafydd Evans: Thank you, Minister. We've heard from a number of places that there are things that would want to be looked at through the regulations, so, exploring some of the things. But, currently, because of the way that procurement is done, and it's quite formal through that tendering\u2014. People have talked to us about wanting to explore things like clusters, so where a health board may work with GPs and others in the third sector to come together to collaboratively put that best service together, perhaps, for communities. So, by having a process that is more collaborative, as the Minister's described, rather than it starting with formal procurement, there may be examples there where you could look at services slightly differently and bring a collaboration together to give those better services. So, those are the things we'd want to explore, I think, through the regulations and through consultation. But a Bill that is competition last, which is what this is, a provider selector regime, rather than competition first, which is what the default the Minister has described is, gives you that opportunity. We won't be able to explore those as well without.&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think the other thing is the third sector. There are real opportunities for the third sector here, as well. That's something I'm particularly interested in.\n\nRussell George AM: I think what Dafydd has outlined, and yourself, is what we've heard ourselves in the earlier evidence sessions. So, certainly, we've had that view from some stakeholders that it's a complex landscape at the moment in terms of commissioning. Minister, are you happy, and your officials as well, with the level of engagement that you've had with the UK Government?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: I think it's fair to say that in the early days it wasn't great. They were just cracking on with this Health and Care Act and the provider selector regime development, and hadn't really thought about the impact it would have on us. So, after I wrote to the Minister, we have had better engagement. We have seen, for example, an early draft of their regulations, but we haven't got the final draft yet, so what I am hoping\u2014. Things have definitely improved and they've agreed to liaise with our officials on cross-border arrangements as part of developing their guidelines. So, it's certainly improved, but it wasn't great at the beginning, I think it's fair to say.\n\nRussell George AM: Have you had any opportunity at all to feed into the UK Government's policy development in regard to the PSR?\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Not really, and not early on. I think it's just kind of having a look at what's coming our way, because obviously, we don't have to follow everything that they're doing; health is devolved. So, once we know what they're doing, we can make a judgment then as to whether we want to follow it or not.\n\nRussell George AM: Okay. Thank you. Jack.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: Thanks, Chair. Good morning, Minister. We've heard the same from officials and other evidence sessions that we hold. I'm just trying to gauge the risk of absolutely not doing this and how real that risk is.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, I think, what we've had as a response from the people we've consulted with, so the people who commission, is a very clear, 'We want to align', okay? So, that's the line they've heard from us. So, there may be examples\u2014. So, at the moment, for example, if you look at some very complex mental health support, we currently commission some of that from England, and what we don't want is a situation where those organisations in England that are providing a service to us now, for what is quite a small market\u2014because you can imagine, we're not talking about a lot of people\u2014they might just say, 'That's a completely different procurement regime. We're not playing; it's just too much trouble for us.' So, that's the danger is that we lose some of those services that exist at the moment. That's one of the dangers, anyway.\n\nJack Sargeant AM: That's a good example as well.\n\nRussell George AM: Gareth and then Rhun. Gareth.\n\nGareth Davies MS: Thanks, Chair. I just want to ask on maybe a technical level; we see a lot of LCMs going through the Senedd that are replications of or passages of UK legislation that comes to the Senedd, so, in that sense, if we're taking a lot of the elements of the Health and Care Act from the UK, why was that not an LCM, and why is it a procurement Bill? Is that the will of UK Ministers to have something different in Wales, or is that the will of the Welsh Government to say, 'We want to take different elements and make our own Bill', as a consequence of the Health and Care Act going through the UK? I appreciate it's quite a layman's question, but just on a technical level, I'd just like to know.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: So, had we gone down the LCM route and asked them to put us under the Health and Care Act, then we wouldn't have had any possibility of diverging from whatever they're going to come up with. And at the moment, what we're talking about is a framework Bill and the interesting bit of this legislation will come when we're looking at the regulations. So, what is it that's captured in the regulations? And until we see that, it's difficult for us to assess whether we want to align or not. So, we need the flexibility through this very short Bill that we're bringing through here to allow us to either copy or to say, 'Well, we'll take most of it, but there may be some areas where we don't want to play the same way you're playing in England.' So, that's why we didn't go down the LCM route.\n\nRussell George AM: Rhun.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: I want to go back to the response to Jack's question. I understand in principle why officials would be afraid that service providers could decide that they don't want to provide services to Wales again. That would raise concerns about losing services. But to what extent have you been able to prove that that would happen, by speaking to providers who say, 'Do you know what? We don't foresee that we would want to be part of a health regime in Wales if there was a different procurement regime'?&nbsp;\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Dafydd, do you want to come in here?\n\nDafydd Evans: So, most of the conversations we've had in the informal engagement so far have been with the NHS and specifically with the people in the NHS who manage all of the procurement and all of these relationships with the providers. So, I think it's their operational advice in the way that they currently manage these that\u2014. They know that there are already tensions sometimes in being able to get services even under the current level playing field, because, as the Minister said, we're a small\u2014we're sometimes a small market. So, we had a very clear message from the procurement experts in the NHS that, if you change the level of the playing field again\u2014. There were some services, which we talked about last time\u2014renal services, mental health services\u2014where they're saying there's a very real risk of this.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: It would be very useful to us as a committee if we were able to have this\u2014even if it's unattributed, even if it's fairly confidential\u2014so that we can understand better those actual concerns that arise from actual contracts that are currently held between the NHS and providers, if that might be available.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, I guess it's their information to give, so\u2014\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Indeed.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: \u2014we'll have to ask them whether they\u2014. But you could ask them that directly, couldn't you, as a committee?&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: We'll do that.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Our hope is that you already have it, that you could pass it on.\n\nEluned Morgan AM: Yes, I mean that's part of the consultation\u2014that's what has been fed back to us.\n\nRussell George AM: Thank you. That's a good suggestion. Jenny, I want to come to you, but then do you want to come on to your set of questions after you ask your supplementary?\n\n"}

By improving grid infrastructure"], "answer": "A", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Samuel Kurtz.&nbsp;\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: 1. How is the Welsh Government supporting renewable energy projects in the Celtic sea? OQ58979\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, investment in physical infrastructure, and a workforce skilled for the future, are amongst the actions taken by the Welsh Government to support energy technologies in the Celtic sea.\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: Diolch, Prif Weinidog. And can I begin by welcoming the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society's rural leadership programme group, who are in the public gallery this afternoon?Prif Weinidog, this evening, I have the immense honour of hosting a cross-party reception in the Neuadd on the Haven Waterway future energy cluster. It brings together the Haven Waterway's major traditional energy companies with new and exciting renewable developers, and the supply chain, to lead in decarbonisation. You'll be aware, Prif Weinidog, that I'm a big advocate for the opportunities presented to Wales from both the Haven Waterway and the Celtic sea, from floating offshore wind to tidal, wave and hydrogen initiatives, and even the progressive Celtic free-port bid. So, it does feel as if we're on the cusp of a green energy revolution in west Wales. So, given the strategic importance of the Haven Waterway and the Celtic sea, what assurances can you give to developers and groups, such as the future energy cluster, that Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales will operate in a timely manner to ensure these opportunities aren't lost? Diolch.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Sam Kurtz for that question, and congratulate him on hosting the future energy cluster event today; I think it's a great event to have here in the Senedd. And I agree with everything that the Member said about the immense possibilities that renewable energy, including floating offshore wind and other projects in the Celtic sea, hold out for his part of Wales, but for Wales as a whole. And, in that, the Welsh Government is absolutely aware of the need to have a consenting regime that is robust, of course, as it must be, but is also streamlined, effective and enabling. I have been in discussions with NRW myself. I know the Minister has a meeting with NRW today to talk about the end-to-end marine licensing review, which the Welsh Government commissioned, carried out independently. The consultants said that there was nothing, fundamentally, that needed to be repaired in the current regime, but that there were ways in which it could be made to work more effectively.&nbsp;Developers have their part to play as well in all that. They have responsibilities to submit applications based on early engagement, best available evidence, and where the quality of the application itself doesn't hold up the process. Then, it is for NRW to ensure that they have the necessary resources in place to be able to deal with those applications in a way that respects the very important responsibilities they have as an environmental regulator, but also recognises the huge opportunities that renewable energy provides for Wales, and our contribution that we can make to tackling that great crisis of our time in global warming.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: I do think there's real benefit in thinking in a joined-up way about offshore wind off the west coast of Wales\u2014the Celtic and Irish seas. I think the free-port bidding process offers an opportunity to do that. Now, as you can imagine, I'm confident in the quality of the Holyhead/Ynys M\u00f4n north Wales free-port bid for what it can offer in terms of growing that sector, as well as mitigation for post-Brexit losses that affected the port of Holyhead. But would the First Minister agree with me that the best way, perhaps, to ensure the growth of that sector, in a way that benefits the whole of Wales, would be to not only support our bid, but also to ensure a second free port, which could enable Celtic sea and Irish sea developments to work in parallel greater than the sum of their parts?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I must be careful in what I say, because there is a process and bids are being assessed objectively, as they must be, by civil servants both here in Wales and at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. I will just remind Members that the agreement we struck with the UK Government does not rule out there being two free ports here in Wales. One is the expectation, but two is not impossible, and the quality of the bids, and the assessment made of them, will, of course, be pivotal to deciding whether or not we're able to persuade the UK Government to go down that second route.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I thank Sam for bringing this question forward, because the potential here in the Celtic sea is, of course, for west Wales, and for the whole of the south Wales seaboard as well, in terms of manufacturing, supply chain, and so on. And we have to have that rigorous consenting regime as well, to make sure this works. But, can I ask you, First Minister\u2014? Learning from the past is important within this. We need the right port infrastructure, and, indeed, it would be great to see two bids going through from Wales as well. We need those local grid connections to actually bring this onshore, but what we've learned from previous iterations is that we need the National Grid to be strengthened as well. So, could I ask you what discussions you're going to have with the UK Government and the regulator about strengthening the market signals that say we must have this investment\u2014Wales deserves its fair share of investment in the grid as well. We can do so much on our own, but we need the UK to step up as well.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I think they're two very important points made there by Huw Irranca-Davies. We do need to learn the lessons of previous renewables. There is still no offshore wind industrial strategy out of the UK Government, despite the fact that we have been calling for one, and others in the industry have been calling for one. We do have concerns that, in the reliance on competitive processes to drive down the cost of projects, that will result in the cheapest supply chain solutions, rather than investing in the long-term value, which is to be had there for Wales by making sure not only that energy is produced in the Celtic sea, but that everything that goes into that has a local supply chain, creating jobs in the process.As to the grid, I sometimes think, Llywydd, because it is called the National Grid, that people don't realise that this is a private company, listed on the stock market, distributing \u00a31 billion every year in dividends to shareholders. Indeed, it distributed \u00a34.5 billion in 2017 alone, directly into the hands of shareholders, when we know that there is not enough investment going into the vital connections that the grid provides. When I was in Ireland in the autumn, Llywydd, I took part in a round-table discussion with the foreign Minister of the Irish Government and developers interested in the Celtic sea from the Irish perspective as well. I was struck by what a major developer said there\u2014that their greatest fear was that they would bring the energy all the way to the beach and then there would be nothing that you could do with it, because there would be no connection into the grid.I saw an article just this week by Molly Scott Cato, the Green economist, saying that there are almost 700 renewable energy projects on hold across the United Kingdom, waiting for the National Grid to find them capacity. Well, my own preference would be to bring the National Grid under public control so that it was run in the public interest and where there was no leakage into private profit of the resources of that company. In the meantime, we work with the company and with others here in Wales. We were glad to see, last year, a move towards anticipatory demand in the grid system, glad to see that the latest energy Minister at the UK Government says that improving the grid is his top priority, in all his responsibilities. There is undoubtedly a need for a step change in making sure that the grid is fit not just for today, but for the future, so that when we put the Celtic sea to work, in the way that Sam Kurtz said in his original question, there will be the infrastructure there to take up the energy that will be produced.\n\nJoel James MS: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the impact on Wales of the recent transition to the new UK subsidy control regime? OQ58972\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the UK subsidy regime is not the regime the Welsh Government would have designed, nor was it one supported by this Senedd. We will work, however, with public authorities to equip staff to understand and utilise the new regime, mitigating its many imperfections.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, First Minister. I recently met with a business within my region who are developing technologies that will have a profound impact on helping to reverse the effects of climate change and are in the process of applying for Welsh Government funding, but it seems like the whole process is taking considerable time and much longer than previous applications, which is having a detrimental impact on their forward planning. I'm conscious that you cannot discuss individual applications, but I'm wondering if the delay in the application process is due to a cut in funding, and, in which case, what levels of funding are now available and what will be the ratio of grant to loan in those settlements? Or, if the delay is due to the transition to the new UK subsidy control regime and single-year settlements, what is the Welsh Government doing to smooth the transition to the new system? Thank you.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the new subsidy regime is already in force; it came into force on 5 January. I'm obviously not aware of the details of the individual case that Joel James mentions, but I would not be surprised to find that the new complexities of the subsidy regime are playing their part in any delays because, for the very first time, the system, by introducing intra-UK subsidies within the focus of the law, introduced new legal risks into the subsidy process. Two rival companies on the same high street can, for the first time, ask for a judicial review of every single subsidy that their neighbours may have negotiated. Inevitably, that makes those organisations responsible for providing subsidies more cautious in making those decisions, because the legal risks involved in making any award have been increased by the new subsidy control regime. So, if that does lie near the heart of the delay that Joel James mentioned, it doesn't surprise me, and it is inevitable that those members of staff in public authorities responsible for making those decisions will be having to become familiar with the new regime and, in the early days, are likely to take longer in making those decisions. But, in the longer run, there are new risks in the subsidy control arrangements, and they will be risks that will particularly fall hard on us here in Wales.\n\n"}

It's our first substantive item here, and it is the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, particularly focusing on spending in relation to justice, and general scrutiny as well. So, we have with us\u2014delighted to see you here again\u2014Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution, thank you for joining us, and alongside you, we have James Gerard, the deputy director of justice policy, Welsh Government; Sophie Brighouse, deputy director, constitution and Welsh tribunals, Welsh Government; and Dr Robert Parry, deputy director, European transition, Welsh Government. So, welcome to you all.We'll try and keep this as free-flowing as possible, and Counsel General, if you want to bring in your colleagues or if they want to contribute, feel free. We've got quite a lot to cover there, so we'll see how far we go. Now, I'm just going to do, as per normal with the Chair, a broad opener, and then I'm going to turn to my colleagues to come in with some forensic analysis of where we are on justice and the budget. So, one of the things we're aware of is that there are pressures on the resources available to Welsh Government, so we'd like to ask to which areas you've given prioritisation within the budget, and which ones have duly been deprioritised in the field of justice within the draft budget. Counsel General.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Thank you for the question, and of course, you'll appreciate it's an incredibly difficult environment financially. The Welsh Government's budget overall has been impacted not only by long periods of austerity up till now, but potentially also significant impacts because of inflation, and of course, the estimate is over the next couple of years that there is a loss in real terms of about \u00a33 billion in terms of the Welsh Government's budget.Can I also say that in terms of the budget with regard to justice, of course, I don't have, in that sense, a specific budget per se? Because my function as Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution, of course, overlaps into, really, all the other portfolio areas that are impacted by justice, and in particular, the Minister for Social Justice and many of the justice elements that are made up are actually within Jane Hutt's ministerial portfolio. So, whereas I have a sort of engagement and, of course, work very closely with the Minister for Social Justice, the budget I have is, or the areas that I work in predominantly relate to, I think, what are staffing costs and some research and policy development areas. So, there'll be areas where it's probably difficult for me to talk about, because they're questions that probably should be going to specific Ministers, but in general, we have tried to and we've kept, I think, the core budgets for justice, for social justice as well. The areas in terms of the Thomas commission, for example, the justice transformation programme, are, I think, slightly down on previous years, but have essentially been maintained. Some of the important areas\u2014for example, single advice, and so on, and community support\u2014have been retained.There has been, as you know, a Government overview of reprioritisation because of the particular circumstances we're in, and there are three priorities that have been set. One is protecting public services, the other is protecting those who are feeling most acutely the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, and the third is supporting business through, really, recessionary times. So, that is where the focus of Welsh Government is in terms of maximising the best use of it.But in terms of the justice elements, I think those have essentially been retained. I don't see any major impact in terms of us being able to continue what we are doing. I would love it if there was more money to be able to look at additional things we could do or how we could do things better, and it may be that there are some things that we end up doing more slowly, for example, or we can't do as much of as we wanted to, but, essentially, we've retained the core elements of the justice budget.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Counsel General. Peredur, before I bring you in, can I just\u2014Alun, you wanted to come in on this.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Yes. I'm grateful to the Counsel General for that introduction. You say you've retained the core elements of the justice portfolio, and, of course, one of your roles, as you say, is to take an overview of different matters, rather than be a delivery Minister in the way that Jane Hutt would be, in the way that you've described. One of those core elements, of course, is the provision of legal support to Ministers, and one of the things we've heard throughout this Senedd, actually, has been that Ministers don't have sufficient resources to legislate and so they need to use the legislative consent motion process. So, I was wondering if you felt now, with this budget, that you have sufficient resources to ensure that Ministers will have those resources in place where they need to legislate.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: What we do have\u2014. I think perhaps I'd turn the question round a bit in answering it\u2014\n\nAlun Davies AM: It's all right. I'm quite happy with the question I asked.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Well, no, I have to answer it by saying what we have is we have the budget that is set in terms of the functions that we have. Where the challenges come might be, for example, in the area of retained EU law. We're not quite sure precisely what that is going to mean and what the implications of that are going to be. The other thing, of course, is that much of it is actually staff and lawyer time, et cetera, looking at UK Government Bills as one element, and if those change or those increase, or new Bills are introduced\u2014we now have, for example, the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill coming through, which raises all sorts of issues in respect of Welsh Government responsibilities. So, those are all things that are new that come in that then have to be accommodated, and they will be accommodated, as we will do with the retained EU law, it's just it's difficult to be precise about it, because you're budgeting for what you expect to be there, and you don't have an enormous amount of leeway within that.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Counsel General, I understand completely that when you've got a chaotic situation in London all sorts of different things can happen, and retained EU law is an example of a chaotic process. I accept that, and I accept that you can't budget against that process. I understand that. But do you accept or do you believe that the resources that have been placed within the different departments to support and to sustain that department's legislative programme are sufficient to meet their needs?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Yes, I do, and I believe we will deliver on that legislative programme.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Okay. That's fine.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That's good to hear. Thanks, Alun. Peredur, over to you. We're going to delve deeper now into justice and the draft budget.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: Diolch, Gadeirydd. Counsel General, you talked there about protecting the core functions, which suggests there are non-core elements, so they will be negatively impacted by reducing budgets. Could you give us an outline of what's been deprioritised?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: There is nothing that we have deprioritised. There are things that we have worked to retain, and we've retained by keeping budgets at the same as what we planned to do, but what we haven't been able to do is, of course, to take into account what the impact of, for example, inflation might be, the fact of the reduction in the value of the budgets that we actually have. So, that doesn't mean that we're not going to deliver, but, undoubtedly, it may well impact in terms of how quickly we deliver or the extent to which we deliver, and that is a little bit that's unknown until you are into it.For example, the single advice fund, we've protected. That's \u00a311 million, and that was introduced and was increased in past years to make up for the impact of UK Government cuts in legal aid. There is never enough money. I've got a feeling in the cost-of-living crisis, et cetera, there are so many things we might want to do, so many things we might want to expand, but we have to work within that budget and within the value of that. So, it's more a question of we're continuing to do what we've planned to do, but how far that money goes in being able to complete that remains uncertain at this stage.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: In your discussions\u2014you've talked about the social justice Minister\u2014what sort of evidence and data have you been using to come to budget-making decisions and some of those things that you were talking about there?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Really, the data is, for example, the past performance. For example, if I take the single advice fund again as an example, we know how many cases there are that we've had in, we know how much money's been recovered, we know what the scale of the debt problem has been. What we don't know and what we have to continue to monitor is the extent to which that is going to escalate. That is unpredictable. I think certainly it will increase. I think the strains in terms of being able to deliver as much as we want to are going to be very, very difficult in the forthcoming year. That is one example.&nbsp;Another example might be, for example, in terms of tribunals. The tribunals operate independently. They're part of the judicial system. There is a very slight reduction in the budget there. The tribunals came under budget during the last financial year, partly because of more online hearings rather than face-to-face hearings. That may change. There may, of course, be more cases. That part of the justice system has to be able to deliver. It's one of those things where you have to monitor as you go along to ensure, but the fact of the matter is that it has to be delivered. We do have to have those cases. They have to operate and they have to operate within the correct judicial environment, and independently of Government, et cetera. We think the budget will manage that, but it's one of those things where we have to be ongoing in monitoring it. That is clearly a priority area as well.It's the same with the funding that's been available\u2014again, it's not my budget\u2014in terms of the police community support officers, and so on. They are there. That is set. That funding is absolutely committed. But, of course, there are imponderables that may impact on these things, like wage issues and so on. At the moment, those budgets are there, those things have been prioritised. We're retaining nearly all the key justice elements. When I say 'core', I think core in terms of what we're doing at the moment. The challenge will be all those additional things that might impact upon us over the coming year that are unpredictable at this stage. That's why we have to keep a very close eye and monitor the development of those particular justice services.&nbsp;\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: Those services and the impact on your three elements\u2014the most vulnerable and the cost-of-living crisis\u2014what do you foresee is the impact on the tribunals, on PCSOs? In real terms, it's a cut because of the inflationary pressure. So, in terms of numbers of hours or people on the ground, that sort of thing, what is the actual impact to people in our communities?\n\nMick Antoniw AM: At the moment, there is no impact, in the sense that we will continue to support the numbers that we have. The impact on communities may well be coming in the extent to which we can manage and cope with the scale of demand, for example, for single advice that's required. The pressures that may come will be where there are additional cost elements to be added on that are unpredictable at this stage, and so on. So, the answer is that we're moving into an area of a degree of uncertainty about what the full impact is going to be. It's one of those things you have to monitor.But, I do have to stress again that these are budgets in other people's portfolios. These are not my portfolios. I engage in the broader sense on these. I know because I chair the justice Cabinet sub-committee that we do take a look at the overall picture in terms of the developments, what is happening in social justice, what are all the projects that are there. In that committee, we don't go into the budgets; those are left to the individual portfolios. And of course, you'll notice that some of those budgets go into health, they go into social services and local government issues, they go into education as well. So, in many ways, the specific budgets there are ones where I can talk generally about them, but I think any detail on them you probably need to put to the specific Ministers in terms of their portfolios.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: And finally from me for the moment, you've talked about the conversations you've had, you've talked about the budget and protecting some of that core funding and core elements, but what's been the hardest decision you've had to make?&nbsp;\n\nMick Antoniw AM: I don't think the hardest decision we've had to make has yet potentially materialised. I think the decisions may well come depending upon what the future pressures might be. I think, because of the approach the Welsh Government has adopted in terms of the importance of the impact it's having on people going through these particularly difficult times, the social justice elements in particular are the ones that have been very much supported and haven't been impacted, other than that they may be impacted if costs and things like that rise, and if inflation impacts on the scale of it. At the moment, I don't think there are major hard decisions that I've had to take, or that other Ministers have had to take, but that will be for them to consider in due course.\n\nPeredur Owen Griffiths MS: So you haven't had to make any hard decisions yet.\n\nMick Antoniw AM: Not yet, but I've got a feeling that the next year is going to involve lots of hard decisions.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thanks, Peredur. Before I bring Alun in, Minister, one of the areas that is covered by your portfolio is the work that's ongoing with the Welsh Government justice transformation programme, formerly the justice commission in Wales, and so on, which includes, of course, the aspects of taking forward the Welsh Government's proposals on devolution of justice. It's small, but it is one of the areas where there is a decrease within budget allocations within the draft budget for the year ahead. Should we take this as a signal of something? Do we take from this that this is lower down the priority ranking, at least for the foreseeable future, and what does it mean for post 2024?&nbsp;\n\n"}
{"question": "What\u2019s wrong with the censorship of the Judicial Offices (Sitting in Retirement\u2014Prescribed Offices and Descriptions) (Wales) Regulations 2023?", "evidence": "  These regulations prescribe the judicial offices that a person must hold or have held prior to their retirement to be eligible for appointment to a particular sitting in retirement office. In response, Welsh Government acknowledges that this is an error but says that it does not propose to correct it, because in their view it will be clear enough that the reference is to the enabling Act. It was the first two technical points that required a Welsh Government response. The first relates to defective drafting, noting that the heading in the Schedule refers to Part 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act, but the term 'the Act' is not defined anywhere in the regulations, so it's not clear which Act is being referred to.

It doesn\u2019t define the qualifications for judicial offices.", "D. The Welsh Government believes that the Assembly has no right to interfere with the wording of the Bill."], "answer": "A", "content": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: So, under item No. 2, we have instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.2 or 21.3. The first of these is SL(6)316; it's a made negative resolution instrument, the Judicial Offices (Sitting in Retirement\u2014Prescribed Offices and Descriptions) (Wales) Regulations 2023. These regulations prescribe the judicial offices that a person must hold or have held prior to their retirement to be eligible for appointment to a particular sitting in retirement office. Our lawyers have identified three technical reporting points and one merits reporting point, and a Welsh Government response has been received. Do you want to highlight anything on this, Kate?\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Yes, thank you. It was the first two technical points that required a Welsh Government response. The first relates to defective drafting, noting that the heading in the Schedule refers to Part 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act, but the term 'the Act' is not defined anywhere in the regulations, so it's not clear which Act is being referred to. In response, Welsh Government acknowledges that this is an error but says that it does not propose to correct it, because in their view it will be clear enough that the reference is to the enabling Act. Then, the second technical point notes a number of inconsistencies between the Welsh and English texts. Again, Welsh Government agrees that these are errors but they do not propose to make corrections. Members may just wish to note that this is the second such response we've received from Welsh Government recently where they've said that they're not going to correct acknowledged errors. This is valid principle\u2014the obvious error\u2014but it's obviously undesirable to have a lot of errors remaining on the statute book indefinitely. So, it might be something that the committee wants to keep under review should we get further responses.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: There we are. Members are signalling they would want to keep that under review. We have a point of disagreement there, where the Government sees something as self-evident and doesn't need correction, but we will keep this under review. So, thank you very much. We're happy to agree those reporting points.So, we'll go on to item 2.2, regulations SL(6)317, amending the Care and Support (Charging) (Wales) Regulations 2015 and the Care and Support (Financial Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2015, and we have a draft report in our papers as well. The overall stated purpose of these amending regulations is to effect a change to the existing regulations to apply an uplift to the minimum income amount in residential care charging and to reflect new pieces of legislation on financial support schemes. Our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point and we do not require a Welsh Government report on this.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Yes. So, the merits point is simply a matter to note. According to the regulatory impact assessment, local authority supported residents will retain around a third of the uplift in state pension and welfare benefits to spend on personal items, while local authorities will receive an increase in charge income of around \u00a38.3 million per annum.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you very much. Are we happy with that reporting point, happy to agree that? We are.Item 2.3, then, is regulations under SL(6)320, the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2023. We have a draft report and a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services to the Llywydd in your packs. These regulations provide that individuals who have a late application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom under the European settlement scheme, EUSS, but have not been granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status must not be charged for relevant healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under consideration. Our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points to bring to our attention.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Again, these are matters to note. So, the first is the breach of the 21-day rule and the explanation provided by the Minister. The second to note is that there is an element of retrospectivity in the regulations, and this is justified in the explanatory memorandum, and then, finally, there's been no consultation in relation to the regulations.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: There we are. Are we happy to note those in a report on this? We are. Thank you very much. That brings us to our last item in this particular section, item 2.4; it's SL(6)319, the Non-Domestic Rating (Multiplier) (Wales) Regulations 2023, and we have a draft report in our papers. These regulations amend the basis on which the non-domestic rating multiplier is calculated. The regulations apply to the financial year beginning on 1 April 2023, and disapply the use of the consumer prices index for September 2022 when calculating the NDR multiplier. The effect of this is to freeze the NDR multiplier for 2023-24. And one of our colleagues here on this committee, who is the Chair of the Finance Committee, will be relishing getting his teeth into this one as well, I know. So, our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Again, it's three points to note. The first is that the non-domestic rating revenue in Wales is pooled centrally and distributed to local authorities and police and crime commissioners, as part of the annual local government settlements, and that's why the multiplier needs to be determined before the annual settlements can be finalised. The second point draws Members' attention to the paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum highlighting that freezing the multiplier will result in lower bills for rate payers, but it will also reduce income into the non-domestic rating pool for 2023-24. However, this reduction will be fully funded by the Welsh Government, so that there should be no financial impact on local authority or police budgets. And then the final merits point just notes that there was no consultation.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That's really helpful. Any comments on that? Are we happy to agree those points? We are. Thank you, Kate.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: So, that takes on to item No. 3, instruments that raise no reporting issues under Standing Order 21.7. We only have one item under this section today, and it's item 3.1, which is SL(6)318, the code of practice on the exercise of social services functions in relation to Part 4, direct payments and choice of accommodation, and Part 5, charging and financial assessment, of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. The revised code has been amended to reflect a number of new financial support schemes by making an addition to the list of forms of capital that should be fully disregarded in the financial assessment for charging for all forms of care and support. I don't know if there are any issues at all here that you want to flag.&nbsp;\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Nothing. Nothing to note.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No. None. No reporting points on this. Are we happy with that, colleagues? We are. Thank you. So, we agree the reporting points there.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That takes us to item No. 4, notifications and correspondence under the inter-institutional relations agreement, a regular part of our deliberations. Under item 4.1, we have correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd on the inter-ministerial group for environment, food and rural affairs, and we have a letter in our packs of 6 February there from the Minister. So, if I invite colleagues to note the correspondence from the Minister in relation to that inter-ministerial group meeting, held on 23 January, and the letter details for public interest topics of discussion, including the Retained EU Law (Reform and Revocation) Bill, and in particular the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'&nbsp;plans for managing the extensive amount of legislation in the portfolio. The Minister also notes that she requested an update on the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, and that she would be responding to a letter from Lord Beynon on the Animal (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, and the next meeting will be on Monday 6 March. We might want to come back to this in private, but are we happy to note that for now? There we are. Okay.&nbsp;Item 4.2, then, in this section is correspondence from the Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution in respect of the Interministerial Standing Committee, and that letter and the written statement by the Counsel General relate to the most recent meeting of that committee, which was held on 1 February. And again, we're grateful to him for sharing with us the details of the topics of discussion, which included the importance of the Sewel convention and concerns around the retained EU law Bill. The Counsel General also, within the letter, notes that he'raised serious concerns over the suggestion that the UK Government might bring back the Bill of Rights, as well as concerns relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill'as well. So, they obviously had a full agenda there on that day. Again, we can return to these in private session if colleagues want to.&nbsp;Then we have item 4.3, a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services in respect of the UK health Minister's inter-ministerial group, informing us of a meeting on 28 February of the UK Government's health Minister and health Ministers of the devolved Governments. They will be discussing, we are told,'common pressures across the UK national health services and post winter planning and recovery'and they will be issuing a communique after that meeting. And again, this is something that we can return to if we want to in private session.Item 4.4, we have a letter from the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being and a statement as well relating to the Food Supplements and Food for Specific Groups (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 2023. This informs us, from the Deputy Minister, about the need for an amending instrument in relation to the above regulations, and the Minister notes that the correcting instrument'addresses an error in the commencement provision'of the original regulations that had rendered them inoperable. The correcting instrument&nbsp;'also inserts transitional provisions into the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, the Food Supplements (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and the Food Supplements (Wales) Regulations 2003',and the Deputy Minister informs us that she'gave consent to these amendments being undertaken by the Secretary of State as they are required due to oversights in relation to the Miscellaneous Amendment Regulations and they form part of the same policy objectives which those Regulations were made to achieve'.So, if we're content to note that for now.\n"}

The first item this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Laura Anne Jones.&nbsp;\n\nLaura Anne Jones AM: 1. What consideration did the Welsh Government give to the Scottish gender recognition reform Bill when creating the 'LGBTQ+ Action Plan for Wales'? OQ59239\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. The commitment to seek devolved powers related to gender recognition, and to support our trans communities, was included in our programme for government and is part of the co-operation agreement. The LGBTQ+ action plan has included this commitment since its first draft. These are policies made in Wales, not in Scotland.\n\nLaura Anne Jones AM: First Minister, last month, you stated your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill with the release of your LGBTQ+ action plan, which intends to make it easier for biological males to enter women-only spaces, push gender ideology in schools, and unfairness in sport. First Minister, there was outrage in Scotland at the gender recognition reform Bill, with polling consistently showing that the Scottish public did not agree with the move. And it's clear from public opinion across Wales and the UK that people see the importance of protecting women and girls, and why such a Bill would put that in jeopardy. Yet, you still push ahead with your plans. Did you learn nothing from the debacle in Scotland? This move to copy Scotland would only serve to deny biological fact and appease a small minority in your party. Men and women up and down the country are genuinely concerned with your blinkered vision on this, and are also concerned by the shadow Secretary of State's sharing images directly from your Welsh Labour conference inciting hate against those standing up for women and girls. First Minister, do you condone their behaviour, and do you finally understand the genuine concern at your plan and your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, transgender people who are going through the process to change their legal sex deserve our respect, support and understanding. That is what the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland said on the floor of the House of Commons when introducing the Government's proposal to block the gender recognition Act in Scotland. I think the Member could do very well to take what the Secretary of State for Scotland said to heart, and think about what she has said on the floor of the Senedd this afternoon through that lens.&nbsp;There is nothing in what this Government intends to do that would merit the description that the Member has offered us here this afternoon. We will pursue, as I said in my original answer, Llywydd, not policies developed elsewhere, but policies that we will develop here in Wales\u2014policies that were in our manifesto, on which we were elected, policies that have been there in our programme for government since the start of this Senedd term, and policies that are set out in more detail in the LGBTQ+ action plan, with its 46 different policy proposals. Those are based on that sense of respect, support and understanding, and if this debate was more characterised by those qualities, it would be a lot better for it.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the Government's response to the roads review? OQ59264\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Rhun ap Iorwerth. The Government\u2019s response was set out by the Deputy Minister for Climate Change in a statement to the Senedd on 14 February.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Simply put, what I'm asking the First Minister to do today is to hold a genuine review of the decision not to proceed with the scheme for the Menai crossing. I note that the Burns commission has received a request to look at different options. I have put forward an argument to that commission for reviving this scheme. Of course, the roads review's focus on the environment was mainly the basis for the announcement. But I have a copy here of the consultation on the options for what kind of bridge to construct and what route to follow, and it shows that the Welsh Government itself selected the scheme that would be most damaging in terms of the impact on biodiversity and the environment, and would create the biggest increase in traffic. And it shows too that smaller schemes would be more cost-effective, potentially.&nbsp; I have to say that I had foreseen something simpler\u2014the dualling of the Britannia, to all intents and purposes, with active travel routes.So, I want the First Minister to look again at the original needs for the crossing and how to deliver them, and at the need to improve safety, opportunities for active travel, and the economic boost that comes from having a more resilient crossing\u2014for delivering on the free port, for example. The roads review itself shows that a new bridge would deliver all of those benefits. And part of the work, Llywydd, which needs to be done urgently, is to look again at how we can deliver that in a way that has the least negative impact on the environment. Will the First Minister agree to do that?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I recall the context at the time when the then First Minister said that we would be continuing with the third crossing across the Menai strait, because I was Minister for finance at that time, and the context was that of Wylfa B. And I remember everything that we discussed at that time with the company responsible for the Wylfa B project\u2014whether it was possible to draw funding in for a third crossing, because there would be far more traffic flowing to Anglesey and off Anglesey. I also recall the discussions with the National Grid, and the original suggestion from the National Grid was to create a tunnel under the strait, and we were discussing with them whether it would be possible to use that funding to help with the cost of a bridge. So, the context has fundamentally changed, hasn\u2019t it, because everything that was on the table with Wylfa B isn\u2019t there now.But what I can tell the Member today is what is set out in our plan. We say that we want to see options for a crossing of the Menai in a way that helps us in our effort to create a shift in the way in which people currently travel. We\u2019ve asked Lord Burns and the commission looking into transport in north Wales to look at how we can do that and to make recommendations to Government on that basis. And that\u2019s how we want to proceed. We are open to whatever Lord Burns recommends, and everything that was contained within the report that Rhun ap Iorwerth has referred to this afternoon is available to Lord Burns and the commission that he leads.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: The national road traffic projections 2022 study, published by the UK Department for Transport in January, shows that road traffic in Wales and England could grow by as much as 54 per cent between 2025 and 2060, with a 22 per cent rise under the core scenario, and the most modest estimate being an 8 per cent increase. Despite this, under all the projections, emissions are projected to fall by as much as 98 per cent as motorists move towards greener vehicles. However, following publication of the Welsh roads review, your Government stopped or scrapped all but 17 of 55 road projects, including all but one of 16 projects in north Wales. Whilst I've long opposed the red route in Flintshire, many of these projects were badly needed, from work on the Menai crossing referred to, to the scrapping of plans to upgrade the A483 around Wrexham. And only yesterday, their council leader told me this was a broken promise, which had already cost them hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Welsh Government millions. What, if any, action will you therefore now take to ensure the well-being of future generations by planning ahead to meet the needs identified in the 2022 road traffic projections study?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, there are some basic things that the Member needs to take into account, particularly when he refers to the needs of future generations. The crisis of our time is a crisis of climate change, and it is those future generations, if we do not act now, which will be left with the consequences of our refusal to face up to that challenge. The roads review is the first root-and-branch review of road building in Wales for many generations. It challenges received wisdom on road building, but it needs to challenge that received wisdom because it is that received wisdom that has got us into the position we are in today. We have to reduce our carbon emissions. Transport makes up 15 per cent of our total emissions in Wales and it has been the most stubborn sector in reducing those emissions. That's why we have to face up to that fact and take the action that will leave those future generations in a better place than they would be. If we simply accepted those very challenging figures that Mark Isherwood set out in the opening of his supplementary question, are we prepared simply to see a future in which traffic goes on growing in that way and emissions go on growing alongside it? Well, this Government is not. That is why we have the roads review, and that is why, when it comes to schemes such as the Menai and such as Wrexham, we're not saying there isn't a problem, we're not saying there isn't something that needs to be done; we're simply saying that the plans of the future have to be based on our responsibilities to tackle that climate emergency, and simply carrying on with the solutions of the past is guaranteed to make that problem worse and not better.&nbsp;\n\nVikki Howells AM: Fist Minister, you will, of course, be aware that for any projects that weren't given the green light by the roads review, the advice to local authorities has been to go back to the drawing board and to consider, in accordance with WelTAG 1, alternative measures to mitigate, for example, local problems of road safety. What specific help can Welsh Government provide to local authorities around this? And, most importantly, are there any plans to revise the criteria for the Welsh Government's road safety grant, for which evidence must be provided to show serious or fatal road traffic incidents before a local authority is able to gain financial assistance?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, can I thank Vikki Howells for what is a very timely question. Llywydd, the road safety framework for Wales dates back as far as 2013, and, although there was a midway review of it in 2018, now is the time when we need to bring forward a new road safety strategy, one that will align with 'Llwybr Newydd' and the national transport delivery plan. And because the roads review is about reprioritising the investment we make on roads, it means that money that might have been spent on new roads can be reprioritised into improving existing road infrastructure, and, of course, that does include safety as well. When the Minister brings forward the new road safety document, then reviewing grant criteria will be developed alongside that new strategy, and I know that the Minister's officials are very happy to discuss specific schemes with local authorities in that context.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. With your permission, Presiding Officer, I'd like to put on the record that our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the man who was killed yesterday in the tragedy in Swansea, and, also, I'm pleased to hear that two of the three people who went into hospital have now been discharged, and thank the emergency services and first responders at what must have been an apocalyptic scene when they arrived there to deal with the fallout from whatever the report into it will determine caused that devastating scene that we saw in the news reels last night and in the papers today.&nbsp;First Minister, last week, one of your Ministers called the Royal College of Nursing an 'extremely militant' organisation. He also said they were'determined to have a fight',and aren't seriously willing to negotiate. That's a direct quote. Is that your take on the RCN and the dispute that they're engaged with with your Government over nurses' pay? &nbsp;\n\n"}

The first item today is questions to the First Minister. Question 1, Mike Hedges.&nbsp;\n\nMike Hedges AM: 1. What action is the Welsh Government taking to reduce river pollution? OQ59418\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Mike Hedges, Dirprwy Lywydd, for that question. With ministerial colleagues, I have chaired two summits, bringing together all those bodies and organisations with a responsibility to reduce river pollution. The agreed action plan commits all participants to accelerate the practical measures that each can take to tackle pollution in our waterways\n\nMike Hedges AM: I thank the First Minister for that response. River pollution is a problem across Wales, but I only want to talk about the River Tawe. We have raw sewerage discharge, agricultural pollution and microplastics. Some suggestions: has the Welsh Government considered taking action to stop water run-off mixing with sewerage? Things I belive that could help include the planting of trees and bushes, making it a planning condition on new developments that impervious coverings are not allowed, except for a driveway with limited width, to have greater control over the use of fertiliser on farmland, and to completely ban microplastic use in commonly used materials such as cosmetics.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I thank Mike Hedges for his unfailingly constructive suggestions as to how we might tackle the scourge of river pollution. A number of the points that he has mentioned I think we have embarked upon already. As far as separating water run-off from sewerage, then the future of sustainable drainage systems, I think, is fundamental to making sure that, for all new building developments, we can relieve pressure on the network, redirecting and slowing down the speed at which surface water enters the sewer system.The Member made a number of points about agricultural pollution. Of course, we are committed to making sure that we have greater use control over fertilisers on farmland, and the sustainable farming scheme will contribute to a number of other points that Mike Hedges made. It will offer support to those farmers who choose to take it, to tree plant, particularly along river banks, but also more generally. And as for the point that the Member makes about making the planning condition on new developments, the Minister for Climate Change has undertaken to write to all local authorities, reminding them of the enforcement powers they already have in this regard. There are restrictions on paving over front gardens, for parking or any other purpose, without planning permission. And Mike Hedges is quite right to point to the fact that the way in which, increasingly in urban areas, people have turned what were previously gardens into hard standing and parking, means that there is increased run-off into sewers, adding to the risk of flooding and impacting on water quality. So, I hope the Member can see from that that a range of the suggestions that he has made are being taken forward already, and there are other ideas that he has suggested this afternoon that we will be able to explore and see if they can add to that overall cross-Government effort.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: It's clear, at the moment, that you're getting your action plan together. It is fair to say the UK Conservative Government now has a clear plan for reducing river pollution. By 2035\u2014yes, they're well ahead of the game\u2014water companies will have to improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and they will have to improve 75 per cent of overflows discharged into high-priority nature sites. By 2050, this will apply to all remaining storm overflows covered by our targets regardless of location. Wales has six out of the 20 most polluted rivers in the UK, and I am sure that you will agree that 600,000 hours of dumping into our waterways and our Welsh rivers is completely unacceptable.&nbsp;So, First Minister, would you agree with me and back the stance of the UK Conservative Government\u2014the stance they've taken to address this issue\u2014by holding water companies to account, and, if so, when are you going to do the same here in Wales?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I don't think this is an area in which there is competition between the different nations of the United Kingdom. I believe that we need to reduce river pollution in Wales, and I'm quite sure that the UK Government takes action in England to do the same thing. It is a shared ambition, particularly with rivers that cross the border, where only combined action can have the impact that we wish. Many of the things that the Member has mentioned are happening in Wales. By 2030, D\u0175r Cymru will have reduced their phosphorous pollution loading on our key areas by 90 per cent, and will have reduced it by 100 per cent by 2035. Of course, there is a great deal more that needs to be done. I agree with what the Member said that sewage dumping into rivers is not an acceptable practice, and that the industry has to invest more, and more quickly, to make sure that it tackles that. I believe that, in D\u0175r Cymru, we have a company in Wales, a not-for-profit company, that is able to invest in the Welsh infrastructure without profit taking elsewhere. I think we're fortunate to have a company structured in that way and, I think, with a genuine commitment to playing its part in reducing river pollution.\n\nJane Dodds MS: Good afternoon, First Minister. I live in Hay-on-Wye. The River Wye is the second most polluted river in Wales, after the River Usk, and the River Tawe is the third most polluted river in Wales. Many of us get our postbags filled with people writing to us about the state of our rivers. And I realise it's not a political point, but I am really disappointed that, once again, Conservative MPs voted against taking a tougher stance against sewage dumping by our water companies, something that would have helped us across the UK. I also would take issue in Wales here on D\u0175r Cymru. D\u0175r Cymru executives get paid quite a lot of money\u2014I think \u00a3600,000 was the last payment to a chief executive of D\u0175r Cymru. This is at a time when Wales's water bills are the second highest across the country. May I ask you, in terms of river sewage, First Minister, whether you would support measures to make sewage dumping illegal?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, of course the Member is right in her simple factual point about the way Conservative MPs voted on this issue. If sewage dumping were to be made illegal, then the question would arise as to what happens when storm overflows inevitably cause pressure on the system. And while I'm completely with the Member in wanting to see all of that addressed seriously and quickly, it is simply the fact that combined sewage overflows operate in a way that means that sewage doesn't come through the floors of private businesses and private homes. So, if you banned it tomorrow, you would simply displace the problem and make the problem, I think, even less acceptable to Welsh citizens. The truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that this is a complex issue, where you can only make a difference by gathering together all the different contributions from those who have a part to play. That's why our action plan has buy-in from the Welsh Government, of course, but the regulators, the developers, the farming unions, the water companies, and we will need to see it from communities themselves. In the case of the River Wye, 72 per cent of pollution in the River Wye comes from agricultural sources. So, while I agree that D\u0175r Cymru must play its part, and do it effectively, unless you're prepared to tackle the other sources of river pollution, then you won't make the difference that Jane Dodds and I would like to see.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on train services that run from Bangor along the north Wales coast railway? OQ59456\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Dirprwy Lywydd, many of the mainline services across north Wales are a UK Government responsibility, and they are delivered by Avanti West Coast. Poor performance and inadequate service levels on this essential route has placed additional pressure on regional services run by Transport for Wales and delivered an unacceptable experience for passengers across north Wales.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much. And I agree with that analysis. But, in Bangor, we have one of the busiest stations in the north of Wales, and there are plans afoot to improve the facilities there. But the most far-reaching improvement that could happen for the benefit of rail users in Arfon and beyond is electrification of the north Wales coast line. Some of the funding that is due to Wales as a result of HS2 in England would be able to be used for that electrification. But, as well as investment, we need to have the powers over rail infrastructure and bring those powers here to the Senedd. Will you make the strong case for the devolution of rail infrastructure to the Government, and make that case robustly to the UK Government, and to your own party, indeed?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those supplementaries, Dirprwy Lywydd. And I do agree that we need the full powers over railways, as well as the investment to go along with those powers. We have some powers already, and we have used those powers, as people can see, in the investment into rail lines in the Valleys and in Cardiff. If we could have full powers, then we could do a more comprehensive job of work in order to make things better here in Wales. But, to do that, the powers without the investment simply couldn't work, and that's why Si\u00e2n Gwenllian's points are important for us here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nCarolyn Thomas MS: Bangor station is already an important hub for university students and, now, with Welsh Government investing in a medical school, a dental academy and the National Slate Museum in its programme for government, Bangor station has significantly grown in importance. Do you share my disappointment to see that there will be just five services a day now between north Wales and London from May 2023, with no plans from the UK Government to restore the pre-COVID level of service? By awarding a six-month contract to Avanti, they are delaying a much needed reconsideration of the service provided, and such a short-term offer will not incentivise Avanti to improve the service or resolve any other outstanding issues. So, I am just concerned that this is another kick in the teeth for the people of north Wales and for trying to grow the economy there, and to get people to Bangor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Dirpwy Lywydd, I thank Carolyn Thomas for that. She makes a very important point. The decision of Avanti West Coast to reduce services between north Wales and London was made without any prior notification to the Welsh Government or to Transport for Wales, despite the very obvious knock-on effect onto those local train services. Not only did it arbitrarily reduce those services, but, clearly, that was good enough for the UK Government, because, despite that, they've gone ahead and awarded a six-month contract extension to Avanti West Coast. Now, I am told that Avanti is committed to improving that service. I am glad to see that the new chief executive of Avanti West Coast has offered a meeting with our transport Minister to set out the actions they are taking, but the truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that the problems on the railway are more basic than any single franchise. The way in which rail services are designed and delivered across the United Kingdom simply does not meet the needs of the travelling public. In order to have a more fundamental review, you need what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian said in her original question\u2014you need the powers transferred to Wales and the investment to go alongside it, and then, in the way that we have taken those parts of the railway that are under our control back under public control, we will be able to do that and make a much better job of rail services in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nSam Rowlands MS: My colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian is absolutely right to raise concerns again about the train services in north Wales. And I must say, First Minister, you have a refreshingly honest Deputy Minister for transport who clearly has concerns about the state of the Labour-run rail service here in Wales as well. He was recently quoted as saying that Transport for Wales could be 'awful' and has been 'pretty bleak for a while'. Do you agree with him, First Minister?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: What I agree was the point that the Minister was actually making, because he was pointing to the decision of the UK Government to set out a future for rail services in Wales that can only be one of managed decline. That is the policy of your party and the Government that you support. That is why they have agreed the next period of investment for Network Rail that has Wales at the very foot of the league table. Every other region but one has better investment over the next period than is going to be offered in Wales, despite the fact that investment in the Welsh rail service has been dismal over the whole 13 years in which your Government has been in charge. That was the point the Deputy Minister was making, and it\u2019s one I think any person who takes an objective look at the facts of rail investment in Wales would endorse.\n\nY Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer: We move on now to questions from party leaders, and, first of all, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. Last week, First Minister, the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru issued a damning statement, in fairness, assessing the engagement so far the Welsh Government has had with the UK-wide COVID inquiry. Now, from these benches, we have time and time again said that there should be a Wales-wide independent inquiry; regrettably, the Labour benches have voted that proposal down, so we do rely on, obviously, the Welsh Government engaging with the UK inquiry to make sure that all the facts are presented and can be understood by that inquiry. Can you give us an update on how the Welsh Government is engaging with the COVID inquiry at a UK level? And are you as concerned as I am with the judgment that the COVID bereaved families have around non-disclosure and the timeliness of the evidence that the Welsh Government is submitting to the inquiry?\n\n"}

The first item this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Laura Anne Jones.&nbsp;\n\nLaura Anne Jones AM: 1. What consideration did the Welsh Government give to the Scottish gender recognition reform Bill when creating the 'LGBTQ+ Action Plan for Wales'? OQ59239\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. The commitment to seek devolved powers related to gender recognition, and to support our trans communities, was included in our programme for government and is part of the co-operation agreement. The LGBTQ+ action plan has included this commitment since its first draft. These are policies made in Wales, not in Scotland.\n\nLaura Anne Jones AM: First Minister, last month, you stated your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill with the release of your LGBTQ+ action plan, which intends to make it easier for biological males to enter women-only spaces, push gender ideology in schools, and unfairness in sport. First Minister, there was outrage in Scotland at the gender recognition reform Bill, with polling consistently showing that the Scottish public did not agree with the move. And it's clear from public opinion across Wales and the UK that people see the importance of protecting women and girls, and why such a Bill would put that in jeopardy. Yet, you still push ahead with your plans. Did you learn nothing from the debacle in Scotland? This move to copy Scotland would only serve to deny biological fact and appease a small minority in your party. Men and women up and down the country are genuinely concerned with your blinkered vision on this, and are also concerned by the shadow Secretary of State's sharing images directly from your Welsh Labour conference inciting hate against those standing up for women and girls. First Minister, do you condone their behaviour, and do you finally understand the genuine concern at your plan and your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, transgender people who are going through the process to change their legal sex deserve our respect, support and understanding. That is what the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland said on the floor of the House of Commons when introducing the Government's proposal to block the gender recognition Act in Scotland. I think the Member could do very well to take what the Secretary of State for Scotland said to heart, and think about what she has said on the floor of the Senedd this afternoon through that lens.&nbsp;There is nothing in what this Government intends to do that would merit the description that the Member has offered us here this afternoon. We will pursue, as I said in my original answer, Llywydd, not policies developed elsewhere, but policies that we will develop here in Wales\u2014policies that were in our manifesto, on which we were elected, policies that have been there in our programme for government since the start of this Senedd term, and policies that are set out in more detail in the LGBTQ+ action plan, with its 46 different policy proposals. Those are based on that sense of respect, support and understanding, and if this debate was more characterised by those qualities, it would be a lot better for it.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the Government's response to the roads review? OQ59264\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Rhun ap Iorwerth. The Government\u2019s response was set out by the Deputy Minister for Climate Change in a statement to the Senedd on 14 February.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: Simply put, what I'm asking the First Minister to do today is to hold a genuine review of the decision not to proceed with the scheme for the Menai crossing. I note that the Burns commission has received a request to look at different options. I have put forward an argument to that commission for reviving this scheme. Of course, the roads review's focus on the environment was mainly the basis for the announcement.

Will the First Minister agree to do that?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I recall the context at the time when the then First Minister said that we would be continuing with the third crossing across the Menai strait, because I was Minister for finance at that time, and the context was that of Wylfa B. And I remember everything that we discussed at that time with the company responsible for the Wylfa B project\u2014whether it was possible to draw funding in for a third crossing, because there would be far more traffic flowing to Anglesey and off Anglesey. I also recall the discussions with the National Grid, and the original suggestion from the National Grid was to create a tunnel under the strait, and we were discussing with them whether it would be possible to use that funding to help with the cost of a bridge. So, the context has fundamentally changed, hasn\u2019t it, because everything that was on the table with Wylfa B isn\u2019t there now.But what I can tell the Member today is what is set out in our plan. We say that we want to see options for a crossing of the Menai in a way that helps us in our effort to create a shift in the way in which people currently travel. We\u2019ve asked Lord Burns and the commission looking into transport in north Wales to look at how we can do that and to make recommendations to Government on that basis. And that\u2019s how we want to proceed. We are open to whatever Lord Burns recommends, and everything that was contained within the report that Rhun ap Iorwerth has referred to this afternoon is available to Lord Burns and the commission that he leads.\n\nMark Isherwood AM: The national road traffic projections 2022 study, published by the UK Department for Transport in January, shows that road traffic in Wales and England could grow by as much as 54 per cent between 2025 and 2060, with a 22 per cent rise under the core scenario, and the most modest estimate being an 8 per cent increase. Despite this, under all the projections, emissions are projected to fall by as much as 98 per cent as motorists move towards greener vehicles. However, following publication of the Welsh roads review, your Government stopped or scrapped all but 17 of 55 road projects, including all but one of 16 projects in north Wales. Whilst I've long opposed the red route in Flintshire, many of these projects were badly needed, from work on the Menai crossing referred to, to the scrapping of plans to upgrade the A483 around Wrexham. And only yesterday, their council leader told me this was a broken promise, which had already cost them hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Welsh Government millions. What, if any, action will you therefore now take to ensure the well-being of future generations by planning ahead to meet the needs identified in the 2022 road traffic projections study?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, there are some basic things that the Member needs to take into account, particularly when he refers to the needs of future generations. The crisis of our time is a crisis of climate change, and it is those future generations, if we do not act now, which will be left with the consequences of our refusal to face up to that challenge. The roads review is the first root-and-branch review of road building in Wales for many generations. It challenges received wisdom on road building, but it needs to challenge that received wisdom because it is that received wisdom that has got us into the position we are in today. We have to reduce our carbon emissions. Transport makes up 15 per cent of our total emissions in Wales and it has been the most stubborn sector in reducing those emissions. That's why we have to face up to that fact and take the action that will leave those future generations in a better place than they would be. If we simply accepted those very challenging figures that Mark Isherwood set out in the opening of his supplementary question, are we prepared simply to see a future in which traffic goes on growing in that way and emissions go on growing alongside it? Well, this Government is not. That is why we have the roads review, and that is why, when it comes to schemes such as the Menai and such as Wrexham, we're not saying there isn't a problem, we're not saying there isn't something that needs to be done; we're simply saying that the plans of the future have to be based on our responsibilities to tackle that climate emergency, and simply carrying on with the solutions of the past is guaranteed to make that problem worse and not better.&nbsp;\n\nVikki Howells AM: Fist Minister, you will, of course, be aware that for any projects that weren't given the green light by the roads review, the advice to local authorities has been to go back to the drawing board and to consider, in accordance with WelTAG 1, alternative measures to mitigate, for example, local problems of road safety. What specific help can Welsh Government provide to local authorities around this? And, most importantly, are there any plans to revise the criteria for the Welsh Government's road safety grant, for which evidence must be provided to show serious or fatal road traffic incidents before a local authority is able to gain financial assistance?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, can I thank Vikki Howells for what is a very timely question. Llywydd, the road safety framework for Wales dates back as far as 2013, and, although there was a midway review of it in 2018, now is the time when we need to bring forward a new road safety strategy, one that will align with 'Llwybr Newydd' and the national transport delivery plan. And because the roads review is about reprioritising the investment we make on roads, it means that money that might have been spent on new roads can be reprioritised into improving existing road infrastructure, and, of course, that does include safety as well. When the Minister brings forward the new road safety document, then reviewing grant criteria will be developed alongside that new strategy, and I know that the Minister's officials are very happy to discuss specific schemes with local authorities in that context.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. With your permission, Presiding Officer, I'd like to put on the record that our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the man who was killed yesterday in the tragedy in Swansea, and, also, I'm pleased to hear that two of the three people who went into hospital have now been discharged, and thank the emergency services and first responders at what must have been an apocalyptic scene when they arrived there to deal with the fallout from whatever the report into it will determine caused that devastating scene that we saw in the news reels last night and in the papers today.&nbsp;First Minister, last week, one of your Ministers called the Royal College of Nursing an 'extremely militant' organisation. He also said they were'determined to have a fight',and aren't seriously willing to negotiate. That's a direct quote. Is that your take on the RCN and the dispute that they're engaged with with your Government over nurses' pay? &nbsp;\n\n"}
{"question": "Which of the following is not a merits point for SL(6)319, the Non-Domestic Rating (Multiplier) (Wales) Regulations 2023?", "evidence": "  The first is that the non-domestic rating revenue in Wales is pooled centrally and distributed to local authorities and police and crime commissioners, as part of the annual local government settlements, and that's why the multiplier needs to be determined before the annual settlements can be finalised.

", "options": ["And then the final merits point just notes that there was no consultation."], "answer": "C", "content": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: So, under item No. 2, we have instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.2 or 21.3. The first of these is SL(6)316; it's a made negative resolution instrument, the Judicial Offices (Sitting in Retirement\u2014Prescribed Offices and Descriptions) (Wales) Regulations 2023. These regulations prescribe the judicial offices that a person must hold or have held prior to their retirement to be eligible for appointment to a particular sitting in retirement office. Our lawyers have identified three technical reporting points and one merits reporting point, and a Welsh Government response has been received. Do you want to highlight anything on this, Kate?\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Yes, thank you. It was the first two technical points that required a Welsh Government response. The first relates to defective drafting, noting that the heading in the Schedule refers to Part 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act, but the term 'the Act' is not defined anywhere in the regulations, so it's not clear which Act is being referred to. In response, Welsh Government acknowledges that this is an error but says that it does not propose to correct it, because in their view it will be clear enough that the reference is to the enabling Act. Then, the second technical point notes a number of inconsistencies between the Welsh and English texts. Again, Welsh Government agrees that these are errors but they do not propose to make corrections. Members may just wish to note that this is the second such response we've received from Welsh Government recently where they've said that they're not going to correct acknowledged errors. This is valid principle\u2014the obvious error\u2014but it's obviously undesirable to have a lot of errors remaining on the statute book indefinitely. So, it might be something that the committee wants to keep under review should we get further responses.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: There we are. Members are signalling they would want to keep that under review. We have a point of disagreement there, where the Government sees something as self-evident and doesn't need correction, but we will keep this under review. So, thank you very much. We're happy to agree those reporting points.So, we'll go on to item 2.2, regulations SL(6)317, amending the Care and Support (Charging) (Wales) Regulations 2015 and the Care and Support (Financial Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2015, and we have a draft report in our papers as well. The overall stated purpose of these amending regulations is to effect a change to the existing regulations to apply an uplift to the minimum income amount in residential care charging and to reflect new pieces of legislation on financial support schemes. Our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point and we do not require a Welsh Government report on this.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Yes. So, the merits point is simply a matter to note. According to the regulatory impact assessment, local authority supported residents will retain around a third of the uplift in state pension and welfare benefits to spend on personal items, while local authorities will receive an increase in charge income of around \u00a38.3 million per annum.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you very much. Are we happy with that reporting point, happy to agree that? We are.Item 2.3, then, is regulations under SL(6)320, the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2023. We have a draft report and a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services to the Llywydd in your packs. These regulations provide that individuals who have a late application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom under the European settlement scheme, EUSS, but have not been granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status must not be charged for relevant healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under consideration. Our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points to bring to our attention.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Again, these are matters to note. So, the first is the breach of the 21-day rule and the explanation provided by the Minister. The second to note is that there is an element of retrospectivity in the regulations, and this is justified in the explanatory memorandum, and then, finally, there's been no consultation in relation to the regulations.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: There we are. Are we happy to note those in a report on this? We are. Thank you very much. That brings us to our last item in this particular section, item 2.4; it's SL(6)319, the Non-Domestic Rating (Multiplier) (Wales) Regulations 2023, and we have a draft report in our papers. These regulations amend the basis on which the non-domestic rating multiplier is calculated. The regulations apply to the financial year beginning on 1 April 2023, and disapply the use of the consumer prices index for September 2022 when calculating the NDR multiplier. The effect of this is to freeze the NDR multiplier for 2023-24. And one of our colleagues here on this committee, who is the Chair of the Finance Committee, will be relishing getting his teeth into this one as well, I know. So, our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points.\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Again, it's three points to note. The first is that the non-domestic rating revenue in Wales is pooled centrally and distributed to local authorities and police and crime commissioners, as part of the annual local government settlements, and that's why the multiplier needs to be determined before the annual settlements can be finalised. The second point draws Members' attention to the paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum highlighting that freezing the multiplier will result in lower bills for rate payers, but it will also reduce income into the non-domestic rating pool for 2023-24. However, this reduction will be fully funded by the Welsh Government, so that there should be no financial impact on local authority or police budgets. And then the final merits point just notes that there was no consultation.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That's really helpful. Any comments on that? Are we happy to agree those points? We are. Thank you, Kate.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: So, that takes on to item No. 3, instruments that raise no reporting issues under Standing Order 21.7. We only have one item under this section today, and it's item 3.1, which is SL(6)318, the code of practice on the exercise of social services functions in relation to Part 4, direct payments and choice of accommodation, and Part 5, charging and financial assessment, of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. The revised code has been amended to reflect a number of new financial support schemes by making an addition to the list of forms of capital that should be fully disregarded in the financial assessment for charging for all forms of care and support. I don't know if there are any issues at all here that you want to flag.&nbsp;\n\nKate Rabaiotti: Nothing. Nothing to note.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: No. None. No reporting points on this. Are we happy with that, colleagues? We are. Thank you. So, we agree the reporting points there.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: That takes us to item No. 4, notifications and correspondence under the inter-institutional relations agreement, a regular part of our deliberations. Under item 4.1, we have correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd on the inter-ministerial group for environment, food and rural affairs, and we have a letter in our packs of 6 February there from the Minister. So, if I invite colleagues to note the correspondence from the Minister in relation to that inter-ministerial group meeting, held on 23 January, and the letter details for public interest topics of discussion, including the Retained EU Law (Reform and Revocation) Bill, and in particular the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'&nbsp;plans for managing the extensive amount of legislation in the portfolio. The Minister also notes that she requested an update on the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, and that she would be responding to a letter from Lord Beynon on the Animal (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, and the next meeting will be on Monday 6 March. We might want to come back to this in private, but are we happy to note that for now? There we are. Okay.&nbsp;Item 4.2, then, in this section is correspondence from the Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution in respect of the Interministerial Standing Committee, and that letter and the written statement by the Counsel General relate to the most recent meeting of that committee, which was held on 1 February. And again, we're grateful to him for sharing with us the details of the topics of discussion, which included the importance of the Sewel convention and concerns around the retained EU law Bill. The Counsel General also, within the letter, notes that he'raised serious concerns over the suggestion that the UK Government might bring back the Bill of Rights, as well as concerns relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill'as well. So, they obviously had a full agenda there on that day. Again, we can return to these in private session if colleagues want to.&nbsp;Then we have item 4.3, a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services in respect of the UK health Minister's inter-ministerial group, informing us of a meeting on 28 February of the UK Government's health Minister and health Ministers of the devolved Governments. They will be discussing, we are told,'common pressures across the UK national health services and post winter planning and recovery'and they will be issuing a communique after that meeting. And again, this is something that we can return to if we want to in private session.Item 4.4, we have a letter from the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being and a statement as well relating to the Food Supplements and Food for Specific Groups (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 2023. This informs us, from the Deputy Minister, about the need for an amending instrument in relation to the above regulations, and the Minister notes that the correcting instrument'addresses an error in the commencement provision'of the original regulations that had rendered them inoperable. The correcting instrument&nbsp;'also inserts transitional provisions into the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, the Food Supplements (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and the Food Supplements (Wales) Regulations 2003',and the Deputy Minister informs us that she'gave consent to these amendments being undertaken by the Secretary of State as they are required due to oversights in relation to the Miscellaneous Amendment Regulations and they form part of the same policy objectives which those Regulations were made to achieve'.So, if we're content to note that for now.\n"}
{"question": "what is Andrew RT Davies AM \u2018s attitude towards the special measures?", "evidence": "Andrew RT Davies AM: The point I was making about the special measures, First Minister, was that residents in north Wales, given that the health board was only recently taken out of special measures, would understandably be shocked that it's going back into special measures after being in special measures for six years.", "options": ["Andrew RT Davies AM: The point I was making about the special measures, First Minister, was that residents in north Wales, given that the health board was only recently taken out of special measures, would understandably be shocked that it's going back into special measures after being in special measures for six years."], "answer": "B", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon. As we begin this afternoon's session, and, on behalf of you all, I'm sure, I would like to welcome the First Minister back to Plenary. And the first item will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Ken Skates.&nbsp;\n\nKen Skates AM: 1. What is the Welsh Government doing to help young people into employment in Clwyd South? OQ59159\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the continued buoyancy of the economy in north-east Wales is the single greatest help to young people entering employment in the Member\u2019s constituency. For those further from the labour market, the young person\u2019s guarantee provides a range of assistance to prepare young people for, and place them in, the world of work.\n\nKen Skates AM: Thank you, First Minister. The young people's guarantee really has been a tremendous success in the year that it's been operating, having found work for 11,000 people across Wales. And the unemployment rate in Wales continues to track below the UK unemployment rate average as well. What can employers do to attract the workforce&nbsp;of the future, alongside, obviously, the range of excellent Welsh Labour Government schemes such as the young people's guarantee?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, Welsh Government officials have been engaged recently in a series of meetings with employers in different parts of Wales, including in north Wales. And the story out there, as you know, is no longer a shortage of work, but a shortage of workers. There are 330,000 fewer people in the workforce across the United Kingdom than there were in 2016. And that means that young people in particular are sought after by employers, and the nature of the discussion has been about the sorts of things that young people say to employers that they are looking for. And they're looking for a career path and progression, they're looking for flexibility in the workplace, they're looking for the values that they see an employer bringing\u2014a commitment to fair work, a commitment to climate responsibilities. So, I think there are lessons, very clearly, from young people themselves, about the sorts of things that they will find attractive in a workplace where they are a scarce resource.The responsibility of Government, Llywydd, comes in making sure that those young people who are not yet ready to enter the workplace get every help that they can through the young person's guarantee, whether that is a place in training, whether it's skill development, whether it's supported placements in the workplace, so that we can make sure that all those young people in Wales, looking to make their contribution to our economy, are fully equipped to do so.&nbsp;\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I'm grateful to Ken Skates for submitting today's important question. I would like to echo the comments made by him, and by you as well, First Minister, in relation to the young person's guarantee, something which, on these sides of the benches, we have been supporting. Of course, as you outlined, it's that offer there for everyone under the age of 25\u2014the offer of work, education, training or self-employment. And, last week, First Minister, I had the privilege of joining the vice-chancellor and her team at Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University to hear about all the good work taking place in the business school in particular at the university, and to hear about their relationship with industry, and with businesses in Wrexham and Clwyd South, and in north Wales as a region. So, First Minister, will you join me in recognising the importance of that relationship between higher education and business and industries in north Wales, and in Wales as a whole, and how do you think that that important relationship can be built on to ensure that young people have the opportunity for employment in my region of north Wales?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Sam Rowlands for that and absolutely agree with the point he's making, and not just higher education, but further education as well, and north Wales is particularly blessed, I think, in the quality of further education that is provided to young people in those regions.&nbsp;We know that the experience of the pandemic means that even young people who have attended higher education have a sense of needing to build confidence back in order to be in the workplace. And it is interesting that a number of the schemes that run under the remit of the youth guarantee are actually taking young people who have graduated already under their wing in order to give them that start. And the relationship between the providers of further and higher education and the world of work, I think, is fundamentally important in making sure that those young people who need just that extra step on their journey early on, to make up for some of the experiences that they will have had to navigate over recent times, that that extra help is available to them, and supported from both sides.\n\nGareth Davies MS: 2. What discussions has the First Minister had with Denbighshire County Council regarding plans to replace the Llannerch bridge between Trefnant and Tremeirchion? OQ59153\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Following discussions with Welsh Government officials, I can confirm that the council has bid for funding via our resilient roads fund to assist with the replacement of the bridge.\n\nGareth Davies MS: Thank you for that answer, First Minister. A public meeting was recently held at the White House in Rhuallt, regarding progress with the much-needed reconstruction of Llannerch bridge, following its erosion through natural causes with storm Christoph, back in 2021. Local Denbighshire residents, councillors, council leaders, and departmental heads from the authority engaged productively on officers' strategy to complete a replacement by 2026, pending Welsh Government's approval of Denbighshire County Council's recently submitted, as you've mentioned, business case for funding. As you know, residents of rural communities such as Trefnant and Tremeirchion have been isolated for two years since the bridge's collapse, and the lack of a replacement continues to prove a barrier to the Welsh Government's own climate change policy on banning road building in Wales, also necessitating lengthy road diversions and adding to burdensome costs to family budgets and various council departmental budgets. The overwhelming character of the public meeting was of a united endeavour and wish to work across the political divide to ensure that this key piece of local and historic infrastructure is restored at the earliest juncture. So, First Minister, can you today provide details of your observations of the business case from Denbighshire County Council, and detail your strategy for making sure that the good people of rural Denbighshire can stay connected, with the replacement of Llannerch bridge, to ensure the safe movement of rural residents in Denbighshire? Thank you.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Gareth Davies for those further questions. I agree with him\u2014it's certainly not a matter of political contention that the needs of those local residents need to be attended to. The resilient roads fund, Llywydd, normally only takes applications from pre-existing schemes, but in this case, with the bridge having been destroyed by natural causes, an exception has been made so that a bid can be made to that fund. And the bid, as the Member said, has now been received. It looks for some hundreds of thousands of pounds in the next financial year in order to do the necessary preparation work, because while the proposal, as I understand it, is essentially for a like-for-like replacement, with some additional active travel components, even a like-for-like bridge will require design work, and there will need to be modelling, given that it was flooding that caused the destruction of the bridge, and it's possible that some modest land acquisition will be needed to take it forward. Those are the components of work that Denbighshire County Council look to complete in the next financial year. Now, I have to just say to the Member that there are a large number of bids, as you would expect, for that fund, and officials are having to assess all the bids that come in, in the fairest possible way, and then will look to see whether it is possible to provide the funding that is being looked for next year, so that that necessary preparatory work can be completed and residents in the Member's constituency can look forward to a positive plan for the bridge to be replaced.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you very much, Presiding Officer. First Minister, the news that the Welsh Government was putting Betsi Cadwaladr into special measures yesterday took some people by surprise, but wasn't unexpected, given the auditor general's report from the week before. The actions of the health Minister in requesting the resignations of the independent board members, given the content of that report, were surprising, because in the report it talks of the cohesiveness of the independent board members in their ability to hold the executive members to account and their frustration at the executive members not being able to engage fully. The chief executive or chief operating officer of the community health council up there has said he was shocked to see that the independent board members had to resign. Why did the independent board members, bearing in mind the words in the report about the cohesiveness and the work that they were doing as independent board members, have to resign?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, I don't think, myself, Llywydd, that it could have come as a shock to anybody who was reasonably well-informed about the operation of the board. I'm looking now at the letter sent by Janet Finch-Saunders, a member of the leader of the opposition's own group, to the Minister in which she called for the entire removal of the board, including independent members who are found to be unable to deliver what is required by internal interventions. If it was apparent to a local Conservative Member that independent members needed to be removed, I find it difficult to imagine that it was shocking news to anybody else in the north of Wales. What the Minister did was to make an assessment of what the auditor general had said, plus other sources of information that concluded that the fractured relationships within the board were clear, ongoing, deep-seated and intractable and that working relations could not be repaired. That is the basis on which the Minister made her decision.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: The point I was making about the special measures, First Minister, was that residents in north Wales, given that the health board was only recently taken out of special measures, would understandably be shocked that it's going back into special measures after being in special measures for six years. The independent members of the board, by the words of the report of the auditor general, were working in a cohesive manner to hold the executive to account. Now, I hear what you say about my colleague Janet Finch-Saunders, the Member for Aberconwy, and I'm sure, through her interactions, she has formed an opinion, but the comments from the health Minister, stating that these independent members had to resign, do not bear fruit with the evidence that the auditor general had in his report. The point I am making to you is that, throughout that report, the executive members were held to be deficient in their work and their responsibilities, and, actually, the arguments and discussions that were held within the board, very often, were at the feet of those executive members being poorly informed, not across the issues that they had executive responsibility for, and yet each and every one of those individuals is still in place. So, can you not see where the ability to understand the logic of demanding the independent members resign\u2014? But executive members, who are criticised right the way through this report\u2014right the way through this report\u2014are still in post.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I understand a number of the points that the Member makes, and what I think he needs to do is to allow the story to continue to unfold. What you saw yesterday was the first set of measures that the Minister has taken. There are very real criticisms of executive members and those, too, will need to be attended to. The fact that those actions were not taken yesterday should not be taken as meaning that no action will be taken at all. It's just that things have to be done in a way that respects people's legal rights and in a way that would stand up to external scrutiny. The board, however, has to operate as a coherent whole, and you cannot, I think, sensibly separate the responsibilities of the executive and the independent members. When you have reports of a breakdown in those relationships, when you read of the way in which the conduct and behaviour of the board has itself become part of the problem of providing health services in north Wales, then actions to deal with the whole of the board, including its independent members, who are not exonerated in any way by the auditor general's report, nor by other information from north Wales\u2014. What you saw yesterday was a starting point. There is a good deal more to do.\n\n"}

Thank you very much indeed, Susan, for joining us. I just wondered if I could ask you the first question. I'm just going to get my notes. Could you just tell us which groups of the population have been most affected by food poverty over the recent months and whether you expect this to get worse or better in the next few months?&nbsp;\n\nSusan Lloyd-Selby: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come and address the inquiry this morning, and thank you for the question. You'll have seen from our written evidence submission that, sadly, foodbank use in Wales increased significantly in the first six months of this year. Wales saw a 38 per cent increase, which was the highest increase of all the UK nations. Our research and our stats show that there are people within the population that are disproportionately impacted by poverty, and particularly at the moment by cost-of-living increases. Our foodbanks would be seeing significant numbers of people with a disability, families with children, not surprisingly, but also here in Wales we do see a significant number of people who are working and whose income and circumstances are simply not sufficient for them to meet their essentials, and so they're having to turn to foodbanks for support.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Some of our other witnesses, two weeks ago, talked about the 'new poor' joining the people who'd always been poor and this cost-of-living crisis is the latest challenge being thrown at them\u2014that there was a new set of people who were feeling almost like a rabbit in the headlights and that they'd never been in this situation before. I wondered if you have noticed that amongst the people who use foodbanks.&nbsp;\n\nSusan Lloyd-Selby: Yes, we have. I was looking at some of the messages that have come in to some of our local foodbanks over the last week. These are just some examples. Somebody contacted us to say, 'I'm sorry to ask for help, but please can you help my sister? She's waiting for money to go into her account but it won't be there for five or six days. I'm struggling myself, and I can't help her. She hasn't got any food and she's got no money for a train to get to you. Is there anything you can do to help her get food?' And another message: 'Can I ask how I can get help, please, if possible? Me and the family are on our knees trying to find help. I don't know what to do. Thanks in advance and God bless you.' Those messages are indications of people who've never used a foodbank before, and don't know how to go about getting help with their financial crisis. Our stats\u2014that huge 38 per cent increase\u2014are an indication that there's a whole group of people who've never found themselves in this situation before and simply don't know where to turn. Often, they'll turn to a foodbank as the first port of call because the desperate need is to get food on the table. The way that we work in our network is we respond to that immediate need for food, but what we're also doing, which we think is absolutely critical, is having the conversations with those people to make sure they're accessing advice and support for their financial crisis to make sure that they're claiming everything that they're entitled to claim, because often people aren't, to make sure they're getting help with managing their debt, if people are struggling with that and have never had anybody to help them. It's a whole package of support to help them get through the crisis that they're facing. But yes, we are seeing people turning to us for the first time.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Obviously, there's been a significant increase in the demand for your services. Could you tell us whether the contributions from the community and from the large food suppliers who donate food that's surplus to their requirements have managed to keep up with demand?\n\nSusan Lloyd-Selby: It's a mixed picture. Across the network as a whole, foodbanks in the last three months of last year were purchasing about 9 per cent of all the food that they received in order to cope with demand. But I was looking at the stats over the weekend, and, for example, in January, Anglesey foodbank had to purchase 28 per cent of all their food, because donations weren't keeping pace with the demand that they were experiencing. It's patchy. In Cardiff in January, they didn't have to purchase any food, because they had sufficient stock and people had responded to the messaging around increased demand. Blaenau Gwent, I think, had to purchase 15 per cent of the stock last month.Sometimes, it may be that a foodbank is sitting on a lot of stock, but it's not the right stock. They might be sat on lots of tins of beans, and they need milk to give to people. So, it is patchy. Communities across Wales are astonishingly generous despite the pressures that they're experiencing. But the reality is, as demand continues to increase, as all families are experiencing pressure as a result of cost-of-living increases, it is difficult for donations to keep pace in some areas. We're aware that for some foodbanks, that may make long-term sustainability a challenge.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: But to date you've not had to turn anybody away.\n\nSusan Lloyd-Selby: No. We talk to our foodbanks all the time about the pressures that they're facing. For example, through the winter, we offered every foodbank in Wales a \u00a35,000 emergency grant payment to enable them to buy food if they needed to to keep pace with the demand. That grant stream is open again for all the foodbanks. We have those very close connections, and we know if any of our foodbanks are in danger of falling over. None of them are at the minute, but, obviously, if a foodbank is having to rely on purchasing 30 per cent of its food, that will be something we will be keeping a very close eye on to make sure that the foodbank wasn't in the position where it had to turn anybody away. Thankfully, we're not doing that yet.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you, Susan. I'd like to bring in Jane Dodds first of all.\n\nJane Dodds MS: Thank you, Susan. I hope that you can hear the English through the translation. Thank you for giving us evidence today. I'm grateful for the work that you do, but we shouldn't be grateful, because you shouldn't be doing it, in all honesty. We've heard that the numbers have been increasing over a number of years and in recent months as well, which is very disappointing, in my view. But I just want to put on record in this committee: what in your opinion and in your experience would be the one thing that would have an impact in terms of ensuring that fewer people were going to foodbanks?\n\nSusan Lloyd-Selby: Thank you for the question. It\u2019s difficult to say there\u2019s one thing. Our research shows that it\u2019s often an unexpected crisis in life that can result in somebody needing to turn to a foodbank. That might be somebody losing their job; it might be a relationship breakdown; it might equally be that, for example, the DWP has made a mistake in somebody\u2019s benefit payments and they\u2019re then having to make a repayment, and that can plunge them into crisis; it can be an unexpected bill. So, it\u2019s very difficult to say that there\u2019s one factor. We know that there are several factors that can plunge somebody into a financial crisis that means they need to turn to us. And often it is those unexpected events that people don\u2019t have the opportunity to plan for and take steps to respond to that mean they\u2019re in immediate crisis and need an emergency food parcel.\n\nJane Dodds MS: Could I just ask one more brief question? So, in your opinion, it\u2019s not about benefits that people receive, for example. We heard on the radio and in the press today and yesterday that the Trussell Trust had said that this is about benefits; but in your opinion, the main reason is not to do with benefits.&nbsp;\n\nSusan Lloyd-Selby: Absolutely not. No, absolutely not. The main reason why people are having to rely on emergency food aid and foodbanks is because their income is insufficient for food, and we know that it\u2019s inadequacies in the social security system that are the primary driver of foodbank use.For example, today with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, we\u2019ve launched a new \u2018essentials guarantee\u2019 campaign, and we\u2019re calling on the UK Government to introduce new legislation to make sure that nobody\u2019s income falls below that minimal level. With JRF, we\u2019ve estimated that that\u2019s \u00a3120 a week for a single person. From April, it will be \u00a385. So, that \u00a335 gap in basic income is what\u2019s driving thousands and thousands of people through the door of our foodbanks and through the door of other emergency food aid providers across Wales. That is the key issue, that people simply don\u2019t have enough money in their pockets for the essentials.It\u2019s a crisis on top of that which is often a reason why people have to turn to us for the first time, but we are seeing people who've had their income maximised, who\u2019ve done everything they can to ensure that the income they get goes as far as possible, and the reality is, it simply isn\u2019t enough. They\u2019re in a deficit budget position, and therefore they have no choice but to rely on emergency food aid to get by.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: We've got five more areas of questions to get through, so could you keep your questions brief and your answers brief as well? You don\u2019t need to repeat what\u2019s in your excellent paper, as we already have all that evidence. Sioned, did you have a\u2014\n\nSioned Williams MS: No, Jenny. You asked the question I was going to ask about turning people away.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. Moving on, then, to Sarah Murphy.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much, Chair. I\u2019m going to ask some questions just to dig in a bit more about tackling food poverty in the current climate. We have heard evidence that people are saying at the moment it is 100 per cent worse than it\u2019s been, even when we had that \u00a366\u2014it\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s great, we appreciate it, but it just doesn\u2019t go far enough.\u2019 That\u2019s what people are telling us. They\u2019re also telling us that their mortgage payments are doubling, and so something like an MOT coming out of nowhere and not knowing how much that\u2019s going to cost, and it\u2019s more than you expected, as happens\u2014. These things are just knocking people. One person said that they had to ask their 19-year-old son for \u00a345 as a result. So, how effectively is the Welsh Government helping to tackle food poverty in its response to cost-of-living pressures, and what impact does the support it provides have?\n\n"}

"], "answer": "B", "content": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd: Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Alun Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAlun Davies AM: 1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the resettlement of people from Ukraine in Wales? OQ59465\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for that question. As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. We continue to support guests, helping them to move on to longer term accommodation, where they can live more settled lives and be supported within local communities.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I'm grateful to the First Minister for that. This afternoon, I think we should also pay tribute to the work of Mick Antoniw, who has united Members across the Chamber in his support for the people of Ukraine over the last period. And the Welsh Government has also, I think, First Minister, demonstrated a real commitment to the people of that country. It has both condemned Putin's illegal invasion, the barbaric war crimes that have been committed against the Ukrainian people, and it has also reached out its hand of friendship to those Ukrainians who are seeking to escape the consequences of Putin's war.&nbsp;In Blaenau Gwent, First Minister, over 130 people have initially been resettled in the county borough. We're also looking at how we can ensure that there is additional support for those people who are seeking to make their homes again in Blaenau Gwent. The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine. Will the First Minister assure me this afternoon that the Welsh Government will continue this support for the people of Ukraine, as we continue to support the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Putin's invasion?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for what he has said about the success of the programme here in Wales. I'm sure Members would want me to recognise as well the part that he has played in making sure that goods from Wales reach families in Ukraine, where war crimes continue to be committed right up to today. I thank the local Member for Blaenau Gwent for what he has said about the success of the scheme in that county borough. It has been a genuinely outstanding success. Workers in Blaenau Gwent local authority's support team have done an outstanding job in helping people from Ukraine, who came first of all to the welcome centre, to be able to move on to longer term accommodation, whether that is within Blaenau Gwent itself, which has welcomed many Ukrainian citizens into that move-on accommodation, or whether it's work with neighbouring local authorities. Indeed, Llywydd, so successful has the Blaenau Gwent team become that we have asked them to take a national lead in assisting other local authorities in that move-on effort, bringing the expertise that they have developed, the operational skills that they have, to support others to do a similar job. And, of course, the Welsh Government, with the \u00a340 million that we have set aside in our budget for the current financial year to continue to welcome people from Ukraine, forced to flee from their own country, looking for an opportunity to re-establish their lives, will go on working with all our partners to make sure that we offer that hand of friendship, live up to our reputation for being a nation of sanctuary, and do everything we can to help people to re-establish their lives here in Wales.&nbsp;\n\nMark Isherwood AM: In February, Welsh media reported, and I quote, that,'Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward.'And although the Welsh Government stated it was working closely with local councils to get Ukrainian refugees into longer term accommodation, refugees claimed only one in 100 landlords will take a Ukrainian. And, in March, the British Red Cross warned that better infrastructure is needed to support Ukrainians to rebuild their lives in Wales, and that the Welsh Government should work with the UK Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to establish schemes to help Ukrainians into private rented properties by meeting the upfront costs and acting as guarantors where needed. I know the Welsh Government's still awaiting clarification on the \u00a3150 million resettlement funding from UK Government, but what specific action has your Government taken since then to address these findings? And what figures does the Welsh Government have regarding the number of Ukrainians affected and what has happened to them since?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation. Despite the anxieties that were expressed, indeed, over 1,700 Ukrainian guests have already been moved in Wales on to longer term accommodation. And, in terms of the specific actions that have been taken, of the \u00a340 million that I mentioned a moment ago, Llywydd, \u00a34 million of that is specifically to assist our local authority partners in securing additional move-on accommodation, and that does, indeed, cover some of the points that Mark Isherwood made about assisting people who are able to secure somewhere in private accommodation with some of the upfront costs that you face when you're trying to secure places in the private rented sector. At the same time, we have a major transitional accommodation capital programme mobilised through the Welsh Government: over \u00a376 million used last year to assist local authorities and social landlords to deliver more homes to support all those people who are in housing need. That funding has already delivered nearly 1,000 additional homes, and many people from Ukraine have been able to take advantage of that programme. So, we continue to work closely with our partners, Llywydd. Nobody is suggesting that it is easy to find move-on accommodation in what is already a competitive accommodation market, but I think the success story here in Wales is one that would bear up to scrutiny from anyone.&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: 2. What is the Welsh Government doing to ensure that school leavers have the necessary skills to succeed in the employment market? OQ59496\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Careers and work-related experiences are mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales, and Careers Wales provides support for all schools across Wales to build relationships with employers. Qualifications reform and our employability programmes will prepare young people for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTom Giffard MS: I'm grateful to you, First Minister, for the answer. I ask the question today in the context of equipping our young people with the skills they need to compete in an increasingly globalised world. And, to that end, it's no coincidence that the countries that produce the best outcomes in terms of maths attainment are often also the countries that have emerging and innovative global economies. And in the UK, I think, sometimes, some of us have a tendency to write off the importance of mathematics. People often joke about not being able to do maths, but that's something we'd never say about reading, for example, so that's something I'm glad that the Prime Minister has correctly identified as a problem that makes us less competitive internationally. And he suggested that further maths learning may be required later on in a young person's education to address the problem. Obviously, there are no one-size-fits-all answers here, First Minister, but, given education is devolved in Wales, and, according to the latest Programme for International Student Assessment results, maths attainment in Wales was the worst of the UK nations, what consideration have you given to what the Welsh Government can do to help turn this situation around and to ensure that school leavers have the maths skills that they need so they can reach their full potential? &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I agree with Tom Giffard about the importance of mathematics. Much of what we do in Wales is to equip young people for the digital skills that they will need for the future in which that aspect of the employment market will become more and more important. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions don't match the rhetoric that we hear from him. He was responsible for the catastrophic Multiply programme when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014\u00a3100 million top-sliced out of money that was meant to come to Wales for a national programme that, I'm afraid, has been a huge failure on the ground. Certainly it has not delivered what was promised here in Wales. I'm afraid the Multiply programme just demonstrates the difficulties when Ministers in Whitehall believe that they are able to design things on the ground in parts of the United Kingdom where they have no reach at all. They designed their Multiply programme without a single word of discussion with the Welsh Government or with the local authorities that are expected to deliver it. As a result, it has not been possible to spend the money that was allocated to Wales. That money is yet to be released to local authorities so that they can do useful things with it, including\u2014and I agree with the importance of the point\u2014to improve numeracy amongst people who are leaving school and people in the workplace who are looking to improve their numeracy skills. So, while I agree on the basic proposition, I cannot agree that the way the UK Government has gone about this has demonstrated a success. In fact, I'm afraid, it is exactly the opposite.\n\nJayne Bryant AM: Prif Weinidog, Welsh pupils and young people have such a vast array of skills and talents. In terms of future employment, it benefits everyone for there to be a system in place that allows them to access educational opportunities that actually utilise and play to their own strengths, while ensuring they have the skills for jobs. I know the Welsh Government understands this, so, on that note, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the junior apprenticeship programme pilot, and will we see more pupils across Wales be enabled to access such positive opportunities?\n\n"}

And let me welcome our witnesses joining us in person today. From the left, as I look at our witnesses, we have&nbsp;Gareth Wilson, who is a Celestia leaseholder; Mark Thomas, also at Celestia and a member of Welsh Cladiators; Robert Nicholls, from Altamar Swansea and founder of Swansea Cladiators and a member of the Welsh Cladiators; and Geoff Spight, Altamar in Swansea also, and also a member of the Welsh Cladiators. Welcome to you all\u2014croeso. Let me begin with one or two initial questions before we move to other members of the committee. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Oh, yes, sorry, you are making a presentation initially, aren't you? I'm sorry. Who will present to us?\n\nMark Thomas: I will, Chair. And could I just confirm the timing, because I know you have a very busy agenda?\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: We have one hour in total for this evidence session, but a brief presentation to begin with is absolutely fine.\n\nMark Thomas: Sure, okay. So, first of all, diolch,&nbsp;thank you very much for your time. We realise you're very busy. We very much appreciate the opportunity of appearing before you. We would like to just make a quick presentation to give an overview of where we think we are now, because we remain deeply concerned about the slow progress that we're making in Wales on this crisis.However, in addition to thanking yourself, I'd also like to thank and make a public thanks to our colleagues in the Welsh fire and rescue services, because, in our view, they've been magnificent in supporting us over the last few years and, to some extent, as we'll come on to, they are also a victim of this crisis in terms of the pressure and workload that has been put on them, but we'd like to express our gratitude and thanks for their professionalism and support.The key thing I think that we want to emphasise today is the need for urgency with regard to this crisis. I think by now we'll know that on 14 June of this year it will be six years since the Grenfell tragedy. Six years is an awfully long time, and we remain deeply concerned about the slow rate of progress in Wales. And with that in mind, we recognise that none of us want to be here today. I'm supposed to be retired, Gareth has retired, and we have a lot of different victims caught up in this crisis. We're also clearly of the view that the crisis is not of our making, it's not of the making of the people that we propose to represent, and neither do we think it's the making of the Welsh Government. Developers and builders created this problem. But, at the same time, one of our concerns is that there seems to be a lack of understanding of the impact that this crisis is having on many hundreds of decent, ordinary people who did the right thing. They worked hard to prepare often for, like myself, a pension, to get on the housing ladder et cetera, et cetera, and they had surveys done, they bought what they thought were effective properties, and they've turned out to be disasters.And the range of victims, as you can see, is very, very high. We have pensioners whose pension plans&nbsp;are in turmoil, we have many young people. I know, in some blocks, people have had to move on, because they're trying to start a family; they need to move in order to change careers or jobs, and they're stuck. So, there are many different victims of this crisis. And I want to remind you here\u2014if I can just refer to this, because I can't see your screen; too far away\u2014that this was a letter sent from a leaseholder I know. He's in his mid to late 70s. He's a retired teacher who has done everything correct in his life, and he and his wife live just four minutes away from here, and this is a letter they wrote to Julie James back in December 2020 about the effect the crisis was having on their life. And personally, I know this gentleman; I'm not going to name him, because I don't want to embarrass him, but I have seen physically in his face and his mental condition the impact that the worry that this crisis has had. And just as that gentleman in 2020 urged Julie James to recognise that, we think that is being lost in this whole issue\u2014the human cost. And one of the fundamental problems that we think is at play here is that, as I'm sure many of you know, the corporate entity is a very tough animal. It only understands two things: it responds to the law of the land and profit erosion. And profit erosion is often competitor activity, customers moving away or Government regulation. And it's quite clear that developers have been incredibly profitable over the last decade or two in the United Kingdom, and there's a figure there\u2014they've made profits equalling \u00a331 billion in the last 10 years. So, these are people who can afford to repair our fire and build-defective homes. It's not a question of the Government needing to fund this; developers have the money to fund it.But the problem we have\u2014and we've lived this now, or I've lived this, almost seven days a week for the last four years\u2014is the corporate leadership of the companies involved. Their salaries are not based on responding to our needs. They only respond to the force of law, and I'd like to come back to that, because that's a key issue and concern we have about how we're currently approaching the problem in Wales, as opposed to the actions that are being taken in England. And just to illustrate that\u2014I won't go through every one of these\u2014it is concerning that, in recent times, the Minister, Julie James, has repeatedly thanked and commended developers for signing her pact and co-operating. And we get a lot of very positive words from developers, and you'll see down in the bottom right hand\u2014I think this comes, maybe, Gareth, from the pact or the pledge\u2014it talks about working in 'Good Faith', 'Work Constructively', 'No Liability', 'At Pace', 'Be Assured', 'As quickly as reasonably possible' and 'Within one month deliver a proposal'. And we have this very stark contrast between people using a lot of nice positive rhetoric and their feet moving in a different direction. So, at the same time that Richard Akers, the chairman of Redrow, is saying lots of positive things, I and my own development are in deep litigation with that company, which we don't want to be involved in. So, our whole approach is that, for years, developers have obfuscated and deflected responsibility for this crisis. The only thing that makes them move is legislation, and that's quite key. And I'd also\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Yes.\n\nGareth Wilson: If I could just make one comment while we've got this slide up, because it's a very interesting thing. But, in those quotes that Mark just ran through, which come from the pact and pledge, which are identical, essentially, the last one has an actual date or time in it: 'Within one month deliver a proposal', and that is the one thing that has not happened. The one concrete date that was in there simply has not happened. Sorry, Mark\u2014carry on.\n\nMark Thomas: Again, our concern is, at the moment, that in recent weeks, the Minister has been praising the likes of Taylor Wimpey and Bellway, but we know from on the ground that Taylor Wimpey are not engaging and communicating effectively with leaseholders in Victoria Wharf, Cardiff. And you will know that Victoria Wharf has had some three, thankfully, very minor fire incidents in the last six months or so. And we also know that if you go across the bay to Prospect Place, where Bellway are involved, they were apparently undertaking some remediation work, but their contractor has now gone bankrupt, or there's some other corporate crisis, and they've ceased working. So, again, we have this contrast between lofty rhetoric and the reality of what is actually happening on the ground. And there's a disconnect there that we think needs to be addressed.\n\n"}

Rising expenses and reduced government support."], "answer": "D", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: So, with no further ado, I'd like to welcome our witnesses today: Peter Tutton from StepChange, Luke Young from Citizens Advice, and Steffan Evans from the Bevan Foundation. Welcome to you. Thank you very much, StepChange and Citizens Advice, for your written evidence. I'm just about to find my script, which is here. Could you just briefly summarise\u2014? Sorry, Sioned, did you want to\u2014?\n\nSioned Williams MS: Sorry, Chair. I'm also a member of the Bevan Foundation.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Sorry, apologies I didn't see you earlier.So, if you could briefly just tell us what the latest impact of the cost-of-living pressures are, highlighting any particular groups that you think are worst affected. I know this is included in your written evidence, but I think it's really a question of reflecting on how things have changed in the last 12 months or so. I don't know whether, Peter Tutton, you'd like to go first, just as you're online. Welcome, Peter Tutton, of StepChange.\n\nPeter Tutton: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, committee, for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here. Apologies I can't be with you in person and I'm dialling in. But, thanks for having me. I'll see what I can do to help you.So, what's happened? It's been a bit funny over the last year. So, certainly, we can see that the cost-of-living increases are having an impact. So, we started recording towards the end of last year the proportion of clients saying that the cost-of-living increases were significant, and that was about 9 per cent if you go back to the end of 2021. We're up to sort of 22 per cent and rising now. So, clearly, more and more people are being drawn to debt advice specifically because of the cost of living.In terms of who we're seeing, generally speaking it's a continuity from both COVID and also the decade before that debt is still largely about people who have less financial resilience, people who are on lower incomes, disproportionately people like single parents, women in general are disproportionate in our client loads, people with responsibility for children, and renters in particular. So, about two thirds of our clients are renters, which is almost the other way around to the overall tenure occupancy. And, particularly, private sector tenants have become increasingly prominent in our case loads over the last decade, but that seems to be accelerating a bit with the cost-of-living crisis.In addition, over half our clients\u2014. It's a regulatory requirement for us, as we're regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, to look and see whether our clients have additional needs because of vulnerable circumstances, and over half our clients fit into that category. That typically means people who are experiencing some degree of mental ill health or physical ill health or physical disabilities.So, debt is really about at the moment, and has been largely about, people on low incomes, maybe more distant from the labour market, low financial resilience, not much in the way of assets to fall back on, and perhaps extra living costs like childcare and so on, and now, of course, things like fuel costs as well.That all said, one of the things that we have seen over the past year is we're starting to see an increase in households who haven't necessarily had financial difficulties before. So, with many of the people we see, those financial difficulties can repeat because the underlying income vulnerabilities and financial resilience vulnerabilities don't change. But, we're seeing more people, which is one of the things we saw with COVID, who hadn't been in this situation before. Over half our clients are in some form of employment\u2014many of them are low income whilst being in employment\u2014and about 40 per cent are in full-time employment, and that's grown a bit, and the cost of living is certainly putting more people who are higher up the income scale under pressure. So, one of the things we've seen with our existing clients on debt solutions, who are paying their debts over a period of time, over the year we've seen quite a lot of those people having to reduce those payments or ask for payment holidays because of the cost of living. But, at the same time, we're seeing new people come in who actually have got more money. So, in a sense, the cost of living is doing two things. It's pushing people who are already vulnerable to debt further into a place where they're more likely to be negative-budget clients, who are really going to struggle to keep up with the essentials and, perhaps even after debt advice, struggle to keep up with the essentials. But, also, it's pushing up-the-income-scale people who are vulnerable to debt and it's bringing households that, before the cost-of-living crisis, as you might expect, were not vulnerable to debt and did not need debt advice, to debt advice.What we're not seeing over 2021 is a huge spike yet in debt advice demand. So, I think we said last time I gave evidence to you, about COVID, that one of the oddities of COVID was that debt advice demand actually dropped, for a number of reasons that we understand better now than we did then. We have seen a steady increase in debt advice demand over 2022, and certainly in early January this year we've had some high numbers. So, we had days in January that were higher than any day last year in client demand.So, we're not yet seeing the explosive increase in client demand that we saw, for instance, in 2008-09 following that recession, but, typically, there is a lag between people falling into difficulty and seeking debt advice. So, about half our clients say that they've been struggling with their debts and worrying about their finances for a year or more before seeking debt advice. There are a number of barriers to people seeking help, and there are a number of ways that people try and manage their financial difficulties before coming to debt advice, most worryingly by juggling bills and borrowing, which can make the harm of debt worse when they actually do come to debt advice in the end.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you for that comprehensive reply. I don't want you to repeat the same information, but I think what it would be useful to know is really what impact it's having on debt levels, because, as Mr Tutton said, if people are borrowing money, then we're into a very dangerous situation that it's very difficult to emerge from. Steffan, do you want to go first?\n\nDr Steffan Evans: Yes, thanks. So, we've got some brand new data I can share with you today. So, the reason we didn't share written evidence was that we had a poll go to the field two weeks ago today, with YouGov. So, we had the results through last Friday, and we're launching the report on Thursday, so we'll share a written copy with you once that's written up. But I've taken the time to go through the data on debt, and what we're seeing maybe feeds into what Peter was saying there that the headline levels of debt, actually, seem pretty stable in terms of the proportion of people who are reporting back they're in debt. So, this is the third survey in a row. So, there was one towards the tail end of 2021, one in summer 2022, and then this one where, in terms of the proportion of people saying that they're in debt, it hasn't really changed much in our survey. So, 13 per cent of people were saying that they were in more than one month\u2019s worth of arrears, and 28 per cent of people were saying that they'd borrowed money over the last three months to manage the cost of living. So, that does suggest maybe that those extra payments we've seen, that extra support, has stabilised in terms of the sheer number of people. But, of course, what that doesn't tell us is that, for those in debt, has the nature of that debt changed. Have they gone deeper into debt, et cetera?What we do know from it and what we've been breaking down is that there are groups that are at far, far greater risk of living in debt\u2014many of the ones that Peter\u2019s already mentioned. I think one that really jumped out at me was that over half of people on universal credit borrowed money at some point in the last three months. That was one of the things that came out of the survey. And, interestingly, 10 per cent of people on universal credit reported that they\u2019d had a loan from the Government\u2014so, a kind of budget advance, or something like that. They're quite unique in terms of that being a source of debt as well. Although, of course, friends and family, credit cards, et cetera, are bigger sources. In terms of the other groups, renters and disabled people feature very, very prominently, and households with children. And we definitely do see a skewing towards younger working adults. So, adults under 50 seem to be more likely, in our survey responses, to report that they've either fallen behind on a bill, or that they've borrowed money, than adults over 50. So, that's kind of a headline finding.Carers as well are a group that we've got some data on for the first time, and, again, they seem to be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a group that's more likely to fall into debt. So, that link between groups that were most likely to live in poverty, most likely to struggle with debt before, are absolutely the groups of people where we're seeing huge proportions of them reporting that they're in debt.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. We'll come back to the detail on this in a moment. So, the Citizens Advice graph, which tells more than 1,000 words, really highlights the impact of the removal of some of the Welsh Government support. So, I wondered if you could just briefly summarise how you think that is going to impact on the sort of work your organisation is doing, Luke Young.&nbsp;\n\nLuke Young: Of course, Chair. As Members will have seen the graph, which does tell the story, we are in a situation where the choices that the Welsh Government made last winter and this winter have better protected people in Wales this winter. The UK Government and Welsh Government support have helped a large group of people with direct funding and direct payments over the last few months. For lots of those groups who were eligible, that has kept them afloat this winter. We're now looking, though, at a situation where the Wales fuel support scheme will not be in the next budget, and UK Government support will reduce alongside the energy guarantee, alongside rising prices.&nbsp;And so, what our modelling shows is that we see rising expenses on households and not enough income to cover it. One of the key things we've seen in the last year, just to add to the conversation around debt, is that the average energy debt for Citizens Advice clients in Wales rose last year from \u00a31,114 to \u00a31,419. Now, some of that extra pressure on those particular households will have been covered by Government support, but, with everything else, as both my colleagues have said, things are going in the wrong direction. And so, we worry that, in a few months' time, we will be seeing lots more people for crisis debt support. &nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Can I bring in Jane Dodds, who wanted to follow up?\n\nJane Dodds MS: Yes, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the graph. You talked about the Citizens Advice graph in the report. One of the things that I wanted to talk about is the fact that it appears that the council tax arrears\u2014so, the amount that people pay in council tax\u2014is the highest increase. And I was interested in hearing more about exactly how it works with local authorities, because I understood that they weren't putting pressure on people who are in arrears with regard to their council tax.&nbsp;So, could you just take us through that graph a little bit, please, if that's okay, Chair?\n\n"}

The blueprint approach is well-detailed in its high-level work plans, according to Lara Snowdon."], "answer": "B", "content": "Jenny Rathbone AM: This is our first evidence session on our inquiry into the public health approach to preventing gender-based violence, and I'm very pleased to welcome Lara Snowdon, the public health lead in the violence prevention unit within Public Health Wales. So, thank you very much, Lara, for joining us. We've got your paper, so we've all read it. I wonder if you could set out what the Welsh Government has done, in its vision and frameworks, to support implementation of a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence.\n\nLara Snowdon: Prynhawn da, Chair. Chair, sorry, would you mind repeating the question? I had a technical issue at the start. Your voice was duplicated. Apologies.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Don't worry. Obviously, there's a new policy action by the Welsh Government on gender-based violence, and, obviously, you're arguing very strongly for a public health approach. Could you tell us how the Welsh Government has approached the vision and the frameworks to ensure that we are implementing a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence?\n\nLara Snowdon: Thank you, Chair. We really welcome the inclusion of a public health approach in the violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy. I think it will be really key to achieving the goal in the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Act 2015 of ensuring that the Welsh Government implements preventative practice to prevent VAWDASV. However, I think it's fair to say that, at the moment, the approach in Wales is very much in its infancy. So, we have this high-level commitment in the strategy, but there is still a lot of work, really, to do to embed that approach in practice across Wales.We have the blueprint approach as well, which is one of the commitments of the new VAWDASV strategy, and I think that will be really key in terms of developing multi-agency practice for VAWDASV prevention, which is a key part of a public health approach. It's also a tried-and-tested model that has been used for youth justice and women's justice in Wales, and, I think, particularly to navigate the complexities of the devolved and non-devolved landscape as well. So, I think we have this high-level commitment, I think there's a recognition that we should be taking a public health approach, and particularly focusing on prevention, which is really important, and I welcome the focus of the inquiry on it today, but we still have quite a long way to go in terms of actually developing what that looks like in practice.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, when you talk about a blueprint approach, you're meaning a collaborative approach, are you?\n\nLara Snowdon: Yes, that's right. So, one of the commitments in the strategy was to take a blueprint approach, which is an approach that has been developed in Wales, particularly with youth justice and women's justice, and it's really a multi-agency action plan. So, it takes that systematic approach that we look for in a public health approach.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. So, how well are public and private sector organisations engaging with understanding this public health approach?\n\nLara Snowdon: As I said, it's really an approach that I think is in its infancy in Wales. So, there is this commitment. I think there's a real drive by a range, particularly, of public sector agencies to understand what this is and to implement it, but there's still a long way to go, I think, in terms of implementing it fully.I wanted to mention as well the serious violence duty. So, this is another legislative driver that we have at the moment to implement a public health approach. The serious violence duty is an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. So, it's central Government legislation, but it puts a responsibility on a range of multi-agency partners to take a public health approach to violence prevention. So, I wanted to mention that, because we have these two drivers, really, for taking a public health approach. They're both relatively new. So, with the serious violence duty, they tend to be regional multi-agency partnerships, which are being set up across Wales, to implement a public health approach. There are two statutory responsibilities: one is to do a strategic needs assessment, and one is to do a strategy. So, I think what will be quite important going forward will be to ensure that, with the commitments of the VAWDASV Act and the commitments of the serious violence duty, we ensure that partners can work together across both of those duties, to ensure there isn't duplication or siloed working, really. So, as I said, quite a long way to go to implement it fully, but we certainly now have some of the drivers to ensure that it can be put into place.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Just very briefly, what's the difference between the serious violence duty and the 'ask and act' that we talk about, colloquially?\n\nLara Snowdon: So, 'ask and act' is particularly a duty on health service professionals to be aware of what VAWDASV is and to understand that they have a role in actively asking the question about the experience of VAWDASV, and then taking responsible and appropriate action if they discover that somebody has experienced VAWDASV. The serious violence duty is a piece of legislation that is on organisations to collaborate to take a public health preventative approach to what's termed as serious violence\u2014\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: So, you're saying that 'ask and act' only applies to the health service, not to the education service, the housing service, or anything else?\n\nLara Snowdon: Sorry, it's because I'm from public health, so particularly in my sphere of work we're working to ensure that it's implemented across health, but there's a wider multi-agency responsibility on 'ask and act'.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. Just to put some slightly counter views to you: Dr Burrell, of Durham University, supports the public health approach, but says that the gendered roots of violence against women and girls must remain front and centre. Is that something you agree with, or do you think that we need to change the emphasis?\n\nLara Snowdon: No, I absolutely agree with Dr Burrell, and very much respect Dr Burrell, particularly in his role in engaging men and boys in the prevention of gender-based violence. In terms of gender-based violence, really, the clue is in the title\u2014it's where gender is recognised as a causal factor in what causes that violence to take place. So, we can understand gender as a causal factor, but then intersect it by other risk and protective factors, which may increase or decrease the risk of VAWDASV taking place. So, we quite often would describe gender as a cause and a consequence\u2014. Sorry, we would quite often understand gender-based violence as a cause and a consequence of gender inequality. So, gender inequality underpins gender-based violence, but it also reproduces it as well. It's really important to understand this, because this tells us a lot about what the preventative measures are.So, again, through a public health approach, we would talk about modifiable risk factors; so, these are factors that can be changed, which is the key part of how preventative programmes are developed. We know that people of the male sex are more likely to perpetrate violence, as well as gender-based violence, but we also know that particular kinds of social norms are harmful\u2014so, those that are rooted in patriarchal norms, misogyny, sexism\u2014and we know that those social norms can lead to violence. So, through the VAWDASV literature review, we really found that programmes that sought to transform those harmful gender norms, and to work alongside men and boys, to really critically think about what those social norms look like, and then how they can engage in them, to change them among their peer group, really, is a really important thing that we can do for the prevention of gender-based violence.I think the only other thing really to say on this is around intersectionality. So, whilst we have to remember that gender is front and centre, gender is intersected by other intersections, I guess, of social categories. So, that could be something like socioeconomic deprivation, or race, or sexuality, or religion, and some of these things can make women and girls, in particular, more at risk of experiencing gender-based violence. It could also change the nature of the violence that is experienced as well as the response that they get from the services that they try to access. So, sorry, a slightly long answer there, but we can certainly understand gender as a causal risk factor, which is intersected by other factors as well.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Okay. I agree that this is not <em>Daily Mail</em> stuff. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Just finally from me, could you tell me how well you think the VAWDASV strategy understands the complexity of reaching different diverse communities, such as those you've outlined, so that we're confident that it's going to reach all women and girls, and indeed, men and boys?\n\nLara Snowdon: Again, I think, really, I have the same answer in the sense that it's fantastic that intersectionality is recognised in the VAWDASV strategy, but again, I think there is a long way to go to ensure that the diversity that we have in communities in Wales is represented in VAWDASV prevention and response. So, some examples that we know of research that has been conducted in Wales, such as the 'Uncharted Territory Review', which explored the experiences of women and girls who are migrants, asylum seekers or refugees, wasn't included in the VAWDASV strategy, for example. So, we know that there's a lot of research going on, we know that there's a lot more to do, but having, as a principle, intersectionality, and particularly understanding how prevention programming can intersect with the needs of diverse communities, is going to be really important going forward.&nbsp;\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: Thank you. I'll now ask Sarah Murphy to come in.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much for being here with us this morning. I'm going to ask some questions now about evidence and data. Public Health Wales's systematic review of what works in preventing VAWDASV was published in September 2021. The national advisers for VAWDASV say that the Public Health Wales review has not yet been included in the Welsh Government's VAWDASV strategy. Do you know what the reasons for this are, please?\n\nLara Snowdon: Unfortunately, I don't think I can answer your question directly, because that would be a question for Welsh Government. I do\u2014\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Okay. If I phrase it differently then: do you think that there is sufficient transparency and accountability in the delivery of the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint?\n\nLara Snowdon: Yes. Again, really, this is in the very early stages of implementation; the governance around the blueprint has only recently been established. So, I think we will be looking to see, over the next year or so, how this is implemented. The high-level work plans for the blueprint are now just being published, I believe. I've had assurance that prevention has been included, but I haven't yet seen the detail of that, unfortunately. So, unfortunately, I think it's a bit too early to be really looking at that, but I want to say to Welsh Government colleagues, 'Please do reach out and talk to us about how we can ensure that the blueprint plans are as evidence-based and as theory-based as possible.' We do have this fantastic resource of the VAWDASV systematic review that we can draw upon; there's a lot of evidence in there about what works. Where there are gaps, we need to really understand how we can take a co-ordinated response to research and evaluation for gender-based violence prevention. So, I'm really looking forward to working with colleagues on taking that forward.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you very much. Can I ask why the systematic review covered primary and secondary interventions, but not tertiary prevention? And, what are the benefits of developing multi-agency data on gender-based violence to measure the prevalence and trends and to monitor inequalities and track progress in prevention? How feasible do you think it is for it to be able to cover all of this?\n\nLara Snowdon: To answer the first part of your question, we focused on primary and secondary prevention because, really, they are areas of both research and practice that are generally under-represented, so I really welcome the committee focusing on this as part of the inquiry. There is really a wealth of evidence around tertiary prevention in comparison to primary and secondary prevention, which is why we decided to focus on this.&nbsp;In addition, it would be absolutely huge if you focused on all three areas. So, that was the reason to focus on that, as well as to meet the commitments in the VAWDASV Act around prevention.&nbsp;On the second part of your question, around data, I think this answers your former question as well, in a sense, because one of the commitments of the VAWDASV Act is to develop a set of national indicators to measure progress around VAWDASV prevention. That is going to be the kind of key thing that we can do to understand whether the strategy and whether the blueprint approach are being effective, essentially. I know that some work has started on the national indicators, but, again, I think this is going to be really critical to ensure that we're understanding that population-level change towards VAWDASV prevention. It really needs to be underpinned by a robust theory of change that is based on evidence and based on a principle to evaluate all of the blueprint activity to ensure that the indicators match the theory of change. So, I think that will be really key to holding partners to account, but also to ensuring that overall governance, really, for the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint.\n\nSarah Murphy MS: Thank you. My last question, then, and you've already touched on this a bit. We've heard that the current 'ask and act' duty doesn't empower professionals to act, often because they are unsure about how to handle a disclosure and the responsibility that they will have as individuals for managing the risk. Do you have details of any reviews into how effectively legislative duties such as the 'ask and act' duty are being delivered, please?\n\n"}

Welcome to this Senedd Plenary meeting. The first item this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is from Huw Irranca-Davies.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: 1. What steps is the Minister taking to improve biodiversity in the rivers of Wales? OQ58924\n\nJulie James AM: I am committed to improving biodiversity in Welsh rivers through tackling poor water quality. This includes reducing phosphate pollution and improving river habitats for migratory fish through the Rivers4Life project. Following the biodiversity deep-dive, I am also working with stakeholders to identify catchment-scale solutions to drive water quality improvements.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay, I'd better declare my interest here as the Atlantic salmon champion, but biodiversity in our rivers is intrinsically tied up with issues of pollution, and the causes of pollution in our rivers are myriad, and resolving the problem will require a myriad of co-ordinated approaches, which I'm sure the Minister will want to see taken forward by the Wales better river quality taskforce.&nbsp;Agricultural pollution from nitrates and slurry run-off, combined sewage overflows and Victorian pipework now routinely, daily discharge effluent as we face increasing storm surges, and phosphates from poorly managed construction projects and more. Every river and watercourse is different and every package of solutions must also be different. So, Minister, can I ask you how and when you'll regularly update the Senedd on progress in line with the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017, but also, and specifically, how you'll work with, and ultimately compel, all stakeholders to play their part in effort and investment in cleaning up our rivers and river catchments, restoring the richness of our biodiversity, including the salmon and the sewin, which two of us here in this Senedd champion?\n\nJulie James AM: I should also say, of course, I'm the native oyster champion, which requires good, clean water to be able to thrive as well. It's a very important question, Huw, and thank you for asking it. As you know, the better river quality taskforce has been established to evaluate the current approach to the management and regulation of overflows in Wales and to set out detailed plans to drive rapid change and improvement. The taskforce has Welsh Government, NRW, water companies and industry stakeholders providing independent advice to the taskforce and offering insight. Back in July, they published a storm overflows road map for Wales, setting out clear objectives and measurable outcomes for delivering improvements to overflow management for the immediate through to the longer term. And, as you\u2019ve referenced as well, the three river basin management plans in Wales, which were produced under the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017, have all now been published, which demonstrates the progress that has been made in improving water quality throughout Wales.But, there are many reasons why some of our rivers are really failing to meet good status and they are outlined in the plans, along with the actions that need to be taken to reverse the decline. And as you absolutely rightly pointed out, all parties need to play their part. And I am absolutely determined that through fora like the Wales water management forum, the special areas of conservation rivers oversight group and the better river quality taskforce, we will be able to work together to deliver the improvements that we need to see.In terms of how we can compel them, we all know there\u2019s no single measure that will solve this problem. The First Minister held a summit, as you know, back in the summer, and there\u2019s a follow-up summit happening in February. We asked each sector to stop pointing fingers at the other sectors and to come up with what they, as a sector, would be able to do to solve their part of the problem. Once we know what they are, then we can put in place the measures by which we can ensure that those sectors can indeed do what they\u2019ve accepted and understood that they can do. And then we will have an action plan that I will be regularly updating the Senedd on and on which we can hold people\u2019s feet to the fire\u2014for ourselves and for NRW, but also for every other sector in Wales that\u2019s causing this problem.\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: Minister, despite making huge strides to clean up our rivers over recent decades, the biggest threat to biodiversity remains pollution. I would like to highlight the particular problem on the River Tawe. Natural Resources Wales has confirmed that the work to stop regular discharge of untreated sewage enter the River Tawe from Trebanos waste water treatment works in south Wales is not likely to be completed until 2030. This is unacceptable, particularly when you consider Welsh Water named the Trebanos works as No.1 on its list of the 50 worst problem sites for the company in Wales.&nbsp;Over recent years, we have seen an annual average of 3,500 hours of untreated sewage discharging into the Tawe from Trebanos. Minister, we cannot wait another seven or eight years for this to be sorted. Will you commit to eliminating untreated sewage discharged into this river as soon as possible? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nJulie James AM: Yes, thank you. Obviously, we want to get to the point where we don't have untreated sewage going into the rivers. We need an enormous amount of investment not just at the site that you mentioned there, but in sites right across Wales. We're currently in the negotiations with Ofwat and with the UK Government about the price review for water companies in Wales, and, of course, throughout the whole of the UK. That price review will determine the level of investment that they're able to put in, and the acceleration of the programme that we want to see. So, I, in return, would ask you to make sure that you also add your voice to ours from the Welsh Government, to Ofwat, to make sure that the price review includes the ability of a not-for-profit like D\u0175r Cymru to be able to invest at the level it would like to invest, because, in the last price review, we had a real problem because the fact that it was not a company limited by shares was not taken into account by Ofwat, and that has had an effect on the ability to invest.&nbsp;I absolutely have regular meetings with the water companies, and I absolutely ask them all the time to accelerate their plans, but we are absolutely in the hands of the price review. So, we all need to act together and add our voice to that to make sure that the price mechanism allows the investment that we want to see, and, indeed, not only the investment, but the acceleration of the investment that we'd all like to see.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: 2. Will the Minister provide an update on improvements to the Cambrian railway line? OQ58902\n\nLee Waters AM: Yes, thank you. The Welsh Government is investing \u00a3800 million on a new fleet of trains that will serve passengers across Wales. This will improve passenger comfort and facilities, and these brand-new trains are now running in north Wales, and will be introduced across the whole Welsh rail network in this year and next year.&nbsp;\n\nRussell George AM: I thank the Minister for his answer. What I have noticed is an increase in concerns of poor service on the Cambrian line in particular, on the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury line. Passengers are frequently asked to change unexpectedly at Shrewsbury due to the numbers of units used for a through service. Now, as I've understood it, there are only 21 units currently available to operate on the Cambrian line\u2014which I know the Minister will know has a unique signalling system\u2014and services are often cancelled because of the lack of available units to cover mid and north Wales. The new trains proposed, as the Minister has outlined, will replace older units like for like, as I understand it, but won't increase the number available to operate the overall service. So, can I ask what the Government is doing to increase the number of units overall to provide an adequate train service for passengers on the Cambrian line in particular, and for any update you can provide on the hourly train service? Thank you.&nbsp;\n\nLee Waters AM: Yes, thank you, and Russell George is right that there have been some difficulties on the Cambrian line. The whole rail system across the country has had a difficult autumn. The new trains that we are bringing in on the Cambrian line next year will be able to carry more passengers. There will be increased capacity, and, of course, there'll be increased frequency to hourly. We'd hoped to bring them in this year, but we will be bringing them in next year, and I believe he's recently met with Transport for Wales to discuss that.&nbsp;We also have some difficulties on the Cambrian line because West Midlands Trains have not returned to a full timetable on their services between Shrewsbury and Birmingham, and that's had a knock-on effect on our own services, plus, of course, there have been the difficulties across the industry of new staff being trained through a backlog of COVID. We've had challenges with staff not willing to work overtime, and we've had infrastructure work on the Barmouth bridge, plus, then, the limitations of the existing 158 trains, which, as you say, are the only fleet able to operate on this line, which are coming to the end of their useful life. So, I'm afraid our plea to passengers is, 'Hold on, it's going to get better'. But things are difficult at the moment, and I apologise for that.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson first of all, Natasha Asghar.&nbsp;\n\nNatasha Asghar MS: Thank you so much, Presiding Officer. Deputy Minister, yesterday we learnt that Wizz Air is ending all flights in and out of Welsh Government-owned Cardiff Airport, delivering yet another blow to its viability. Your Government described this move as, and I quote, 'surprising.' However, in August last year, your Cabinet colleague Julie James issued a written statement saying that your officials, and I quote,&nbsp;'will continue to maintain a close and open dialogue with the Airport Board'.So, can you explain, Deputy Minister, in light of this close and open dialogue, did this announcement actually come as a surprise, or did you, your Cabinet colleague or your officials take your eye off the ball and not see this coming?\n\n"}

How is the Welsh Government supporting renewable energy projects in the Celtic sea? OQ58979\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, investment in physical infrastructure, and a workforce skilled for the future, are amongst the actions taken by the Welsh Government to support energy technologies in the Celtic sea.\n\nSamuel Kurtz MS: Diolch, Prif Weinidog. And can I begin by welcoming the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society's rural leadership programme group, who are in the public gallery this afternoon?Prif Weinidog, this evening, I have the immense honour of hosting a cross-party reception in the Neuadd on the Haven Waterway future energy cluster. It brings together the Haven Waterway's major traditional energy companies with new and exciting renewable developers, and the supply chain, to lead in decarbonisation. You'll be aware, Prif Weinidog, that I'm a big advocate for the opportunities presented to Wales from both the Haven Waterway and the Celtic sea, from floating offshore wind to tidal, wave and hydrogen initiatives, and even the progressive Celtic free-port bid. So, it does feel as if we're on the cusp of a green energy revolution in west Wales. So, given the strategic importance of the Haven Waterway and the Celtic sea, what assurances can you give to developers and groups, such as the future energy cluster, that Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales will operate in a timely manner to ensure these opportunities aren't lost? Diolch.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Sam Kurtz for that question, and congratulate him on hosting the future energy cluster event today; I think it's a great event to have here in the Senedd. And I agree with everything that the Member said about the immense possibilities that renewable energy, including floating offshore wind and other projects in the Celtic sea, hold out for his part of Wales, but for Wales as a whole. And, in that, the Welsh Government is absolutely aware of the need to have a consenting regime that is robust, of course, as it must be, but is also streamlined, effective and enabling. I have been in discussions with NRW myself. I know the Minister has a meeting with NRW today to talk about the end-to-end marine licensing review, which the Welsh Government commissioned, carried out independently. The consultants said that there was nothing, fundamentally, that needed to be repaired in the current regime, but that there were ways in which it could be made to work more effectively.&nbsp;Developers have their part to play as well in all that. They have responsibilities to submit applications based on early engagement, best available evidence, and where the quality of the application itself doesn't hold up the process. Then, it is for NRW to ensure that they have the necessary resources in place to be able to deal with those applications in a way that respects the very important responsibilities they have as an environmental regulator, but also recognises the huge opportunities that renewable energy provides for Wales, and our contribution that we can make to tackling that great crisis of our time in global warming.&nbsp;\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth AM: I do think there's real benefit in thinking in a joined-up way about offshore wind off the west coast of Wales\u2014the Celtic and Irish seas. I think the free-port bidding process offers an opportunity to do that. Now, as you can imagine, I'm confident in the quality of the Holyhead/Ynys M\u00f4n north Wales free-port bid for what it can offer in terms of growing that sector, as well as mitigation for post-Brexit losses that affected the port of Holyhead. But would the First Minister agree with me that the best way, perhaps, to ensure the growth of that sector, in a way that benefits the whole of Wales, would be to not only support our bid, but also to ensure a second free port, which could enable Celtic sea and Irish sea developments to work in parallel greater than the sum of their parts?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I must be careful in what I say, because there is a process and bids are being assessed objectively, as they must be, by civil servants both here in Wales and at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. I will just remind Members that the agreement we struck with the UK Government does not rule out there being two free ports here in Wales. One is the expectation, but two is not impossible, and the quality of the bids, and the assessment made of them, will, of course, be pivotal to deciding whether or not we're able to persuade the UK Government to go down that second route.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: I thank Sam for bringing this question forward, because the potential here in the Celtic sea is, of course, for west Wales, and for the whole of the south Wales seaboard as well, in terms of manufacturing, supply chain, and so on. And we have to have that rigorous consenting regime as well, to make sure this works. But, can I ask you, First Minister\u2014? Learning from the past is important within this. We need the right port infrastructure, and, indeed, it would be great to see two bids going through from Wales as well. We need those local grid connections to actually bring this onshore, but what we've learned from previous iterations is that we need the National Grid to be strengthened as well. So, could I ask you what discussions you're going to have with the UK Government and the regulator about strengthening the market signals that say we must have this investment\u2014Wales deserves its fair share of investment in the grid as well. We can do so much on our own, but we need the UK to step up as well.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I think they're two very important points made there by Huw Irranca-Davies. We do need to learn the lessons of previous renewables. There is still no offshore wind industrial strategy out of the UK Government, despite the fact that we have been calling for one, and others in the industry have been calling for one. We do have concerns that, in the reliance on competitive processes to drive down the cost of projects, that will result in the cheapest supply chain solutions, rather than investing in the long-term value, which is to be had there for Wales by making sure not only that energy is produced in the Celtic sea, but that everything that goes into that has a local supply chain, creating jobs in the process.As to the grid, I sometimes think, Llywydd, because it is called the National Grid, that people don't realise that this is a private company, listed on the stock market, distributing \u00a31 billion every year in dividends to shareholders. Indeed, it distributed \u00a34.5 billion in 2017 alone, directly into the hands of shareholders, when we know that there is not enough investment going into the vital connections that the grid provides. When I was in Ireland in the autumn, Llywydd, I took part in a round-table discussion with the foreign Minister of the Irish Government and developers interested in the Celtic sea from the Irish perspective as well. I was struck by what a major developer said there\u2014that their greatest fear was that they would bring the energy all the way to the beach and then there would be nothing that you could do with it, because there would be no connection into the grid.I saw an article just this week by Molly Scott Cato, the Green economist, saying that there are almost 700 renewable energy projects on hold across the United Kingdom, waiting for the National Grid to find them capacity. Well, my own preference would be to bring the National Grid under public control so that it was run in the public interest and where there was no leakage into private profit of the resources of that company. In the meantime, we work with the company and with others here in Wales. We were glad to see, last year, a move towards anticipatory demand in the grid system, glad to see that the latest energy Minister at the UK Government says that improving the grid is his top priority, in all his responsibilities. There is undoubtedly a need for a step change in making sure that the grid is fit not just for today, but for the future, so that when we put the Celtic sea to work, in the way that Sam Kurtz said in his original question, there will be the infrastructure there to take up the energy that will be produced.\n\nJoel James MS: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the impact on Wales of the recent transition to the new UK subsidy control regime? OQ58972\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the UK subsidy regime is not the regime the Welsh Government would have designed, nor was it one supported by this Senedd. We will work, however, with public authorities to equip staff to understand and utilise the new regime, mitigating its many imperfections.\n\nJoel James MS: Thank you, First Minister. I recently met with a business within my region who are developing technologies that will have a profound impact on helping to reverse the effects of climate change and are in the process of applying for Welsh Government funding, but it seems like the whole process is taking considerable time and much longer than previous applications, which is having a detrimental impact on their forward planning. I'm conscious that you cannot discuss individual applications, but I'm wondering if the delay in the application process is due to a cut in funding, and, in which case, what levels of funding are now available and what will be the ratio of grant to loan in those settlements? Or, if the delay is due to the transition to the new UK subsidy control regime and single-year settlements, what is the Welsh Government doing to smooth the transition to the new system? Thank you.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the new subsidy regime is already in force; it came into force on 5 January. I'm obviously not aware of the details of the individual case that Joel James mentions, but I would not be surprised to find that the new complexities of the subsidy regime are playing their part in any delays because, for the very first time, the system, by introducing intra-UK subsidies within the focus of the law, introduced new legal risks into the subsidy process. Two rival companies on the same high street can, for the first time, ask for a judicial review of every single subsidy that their neighbours may have negotiated. Inevitably, that makes those organisations responsible for providing subsidies more cautious in making those decisions, because the legal risks involved in making any award have been increased by the new subsidy control regime. So, if that does lie near the heart of the delay that Joel James mentioned, it doesn't surprise me, and it is inevitable that those members of staff in public authorities responsible for making those decisions will be having to become familiar with the new regime and, in the early days, are likely to take longer in making those decisions. But, in the longer run, there are new risks in the subsidy control arrangements, and they will be risks that will particularly fall hard on us here in Wales.\n\n"}

Can I invite firstly Mr Ieuan Evans to introduce himself for the record?\n\nIeuan Evans: Ieuan Evans, chair, Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you very much.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: And, Mr Nigel Walker.\n\nNigel Walker: Nigel Walker, acting chief executive officer of the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you so much. On behalf of Members, I really would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to give evidence today. It's a really important issue; it's something that has the interest of Members of the Senedd, members of the public, and obviously the press and the wider public in Wales. This is something that has come out following the <em>BBC Wales Investigates </em>programme on 23 January. Would you like to make a short opening statement?\n\nIeuan Evans: Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the invitation to appear before the committee this morning. We're very pleased to have the opportunity, and we are aware, as the stewards of Welsh rugby, that we have a great responsibility, and we're aware that we've disappointed the rugby family across Wales. The experience has been sobering for us, but as the new chair, I am determined to make the changes that are necessary to improve rugby in Wales. You will be aware of some of the changes that we have already announced. Also, Nigel has taken the role of acting chief executive.\n\nIeuan Evans: We fully understand and embrace the WRU's unique role in the sporting, economic and civic life in Wales, embedded in its social fabric, and how we project ourselves is critical. We need to get this right; we need to take advice and seek input from others, so we've been working closely with Welsh Government and Sport Wales, and of course, talking to our staff, our players, our member clubs and our commercial partners about the next steps. We are a \u00a3100 million-turnover business, and that includes some public funding. We take our responsibility for spending public funds extremely seriously. We have 80,000 players across 300 clubs, and many more thousands of young people in schools across Wales playing rugby. We're a showcase for Wales to the world. We have a duty, and a responsibility to be as good as we can be, and it's my job to make that happen.Hopefully, today, we can outline for you the changes we have already put in place and answer some of the questions that I'm sure you have. As you know, we will be working with our partners to establish a taskforce with external expertise to help us achieve the cultural change we need, and we'll have more information about that this morning as we finalise some of those details, as they're not all in place as yet. And we've agreed, of course, that Sport Wales will be identifying an independent chair and we will be working with them and the membership in terms of reference for that review, and I'm sure that we can elaborate on that as the hearing goes on. We're happy therefore to provide more details to the committee when those arrangements are finalised.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. So, we'll move on to questions. Why do you think the WRU is in this situation?\n\nIeuan Evans: As a relatively new chair\u2014a matter of weeks\u2014I've been humbled and harrowed by what I've heard, particularly the impact on our female staff and players. I think we all know that we should do more, we need to do more to make the game and our organisation more inclusive, but I was shocked by the personal stories highlighted by our former staff in the programme, and I can only apologise once more to them, and not only them but people elsewhere affected by the allegations in that programme as well, and to say that I will work night and day to ensure that all of our staff feel safe and valued.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. I'll bring Alun Davies in in a moment, but could I just press you on that, because your words are obviously heartfelt, and I appreciate that, but in terms of why you think this has happened, what would be your analysis of that?\n\nNigel Walker: I'm happy to come in there. I think, in any organisation, especially a large organisation like the Welsh Rugby Union, it's possible for things to occur over a period of time and for people to turn a blind eye, and not to address those problems, and then it's not until, sometimes, an organisation is forced to face the reality of the position they find themselves in that they begin to really look deeply and look back to the past and begin to join the dots. So, the warning signs have been there for quite some time. When it's presented as graphically as it was during the BBC Wales programme the week before last, it hits you like a 10-tonne truck.I should offer my apologies. My thoughts are with those members of staff, those players and ex-players who have had an experience that no individual should have. The key now is, yes, we're apologetic, yes, we've made statements, yes, we've accepted that we've got a problem; the key now is to begin to understand the scale and scope of that problem, to seek outside help, which Ieuan has referred to, and to give an undertaking that, when those recommendations come through, whether it's in three months, six months, whenever they come through, we will do everything in our power to implement them, to make sure that the experiences that those women, players, young girls, maybe, have experienced, won't be repeated in the future, or at least you minimise the prospect of those things happening again.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. When you say the very graphic nature of some of these reports that have come out, could you tell us why it took that happening for action to be taken, rather than it happening when these reports had first been made clear to you?\n\nNigel Walker: To be candid, I think, as an organisation, we have been in denial as to the extent of the problem. So, there have been cases in the past that have been dealt with\u2014in theory, dealt with, and people have moved on. I think each individual case is an indication that there has been a wider problem, but people have not joined the dots. When you see it presented over a 30-minute programme in the way that it was, unless you're going to bury your head in the sand for another six months or 12 months, you have to take action, and that's the position we're in. None of us are proud of the position we're in.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. I'm going to bring in Alun.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Thanks very much. Can I challenge you a little bit on your assertion, Mr Evans, that you were shocked by what you've learned? I was reading parts of your autobiography that were scathing about the WRU in different ways. You said that there were people on the WRU who were simply not capable of taking the right decisions because they were too parochial, too insular or just plain short-sighted.&nbsp;You went on to ask how you could have officials from small clubs with no real knowledge of world rugby making decisions that affected the national team, and more often than not affected it for the worse.&nbsp;And you also said, 'At a time when our rivals were planning ahead and learning from the likes of Australia and New Zealand, too many of our people seemed more concerned with ensuring that they had their supply of free tickets and hotel accommodation for international weekend junkets'.Now, that's harsher, in many ways, than anything we've heard in the last week, and that was written some years ago. So, you were clearly aware that there were significant and deep-rooted problems with the WRU, so what you've heard this last week couldn't have shocked you.\n\nIeuan Evans: One of the reasons I came on to the board\u2014and I have been chair for, as I said, a matter of weeks\u2014I've been quite open and candid in my desire to ensure that our organisation is a high-functioning organisation, to drive us to new horizons, and we need to be reflective. My desire\u2014and you've read the press release that went out last night with regard to it\u2014and, as a board, our desire is to convince and compel our member clubs, as we are a union of member clubs and the constitution dictates that clubs need to vote through changes before they can be implemented, that we need to be a diverse, skill set-based board, with an independent chair. I've actively campaigned to find my replacement; we need to have an independent chair. I'm conscious, for us to deliver on our strategic objectives, that we need a board composition overhaul, and it's how we achieve that. We were quite open in the press statement with regard to what we intend to put to the clubs in an extraordinary general meeting at the end of March or earlier. That is our aim, because that's how the organisation needs to be run. Yes, we have a main board, we also have a community game board, which runs the community game with elected representatives from the clubs, and I wish to broaden that and make it a broader church to be truly representative of our game.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I don't disagree with that, but my question was\u2014I think the statement last night was very positive, by the way, I've got no issue about that\u2014my question was about your knowledge about what was happening. You're both giants of our game. You must have had an awareness of what was happening. Your words, Ieuan, were absolutely brutal about the WRU.\n\nNigel Walker: Can I\u2014? Not that Ieuan needs me to defend him, but the words that you've\u2014and I haven't read Ieuan's autobiography, by the way.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Well, you should, it's very illustrative.\n\nNigel Walker: I'm sure that those words were talking in general terms about the running of the organisation. It was the graphic nature of the sexism and misogyny in last week's programme that was the bit that was particularly distressing, talking from my point of view, and I know that Ieuan shares that point of view.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: There was a review in 2021 into the women's game, could you tell us how the WRU responded to that and would you commit to making those findings public?\n\nNigel Walker: I went through and interview process in May/June 2021. At the latter stages of that process, certain elements of that review were presented to me and it became one of the interview questions: 'What would you do?' I was appointed in July and started in September. When I read the review, I was shocked as to the extent of the problem. There are 40 recommendations in the review, and it was obvious that the Welsh Rugby Union had failed women's rugby. You'll find, during the course of the next 40 minutes, I'm just going to be completely honest with you\u2014\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: We appreciate your honesty.\n\nNigel Walker: So, one of my first tasks was to try to address the problems that were present in the women's game. I remember, even before I took up my appointment formally at the end of September, I addressed the women's squad. They were at the NCE, the national centre of excellence, in Hensol, they were all sitting in front of me, and I apologised. Steve Phillips, the CEO, was next to me. I apologised for what they had been through in the recent past and I said that I was here to make changes and that I would be actively pursuing the prospect of a world class programme for our women players. I said that I would have professional contracts in their hands by the end of December. When I said that, at least half a dozen of them looked up at the ceiling\u2014and I've related this story to them\u2014because they'd heard it all before. But, by December 2021, they had professional contracts. We have made enormous progress against the 40 recommendations. I think the recommendations of that review have been circulated. I'm happy to answer any questions, I can talk about the progress that we've made, and I can talk about the areas that are still to be corrected. But, probably 32 or 33 of those recommendations have been implemented in full\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. And the report, it will be published.\n\n"}

Welcome, Minister, and welcome to your officials, Emma Williams, the director for housing and regeneration, and Dean Medcraft, director of finance and operations. Okay, Minister, we'd better move swiftly on. Let me begin, then, with a general question: to what extent has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 shaped the budget allocations within the climate change portfolio, and how has the Government's commitment to that Act been balanced with the need to address present-day cost-of-living and other pressures?\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Chair. There's no doubt at all that we're facing one of the most difficult and challenging budget settlements in Wales that we've ever faced as a result of choices made elsewhere. Inflation has also eroded our budget to worryingly low levels, and local authorities and NHS organisations are reporting significant shortfalls in funding as a result of the inflationary increases, the pay pressures, and, of course, the rising energy costs. So, there's no getting away from the fact that this has required us to make really, really difficult choices, and the UK Government has just failed to address the significant funding gap that should have uplifted our budgets in line with inflation in order to maintain the vital public services that we all rely on. So, the reality is that we could not meet all the pressures identified to support cost-of-living interventions within the funding available.But, despite that, we always maintain our approach rooted in the well-being of future generations Act, so we've undertaken to maximise the impact of the available resources that we do have, balancing our short-term needs with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and trying to make the longer term change and delivery that we want for our programme for government ambitions, including tackling poverty. This has resulted in the Government, across the Government, undertaking an exercise to review all of our budgets and prioritise our support where it was needed most, building on the actions that we already outlined as part of the spending review last year. I'm sure that the Chair is aware that the budget round this year has been supported by the work of the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee, which I'm a core member of.The result of that was that we put additional allocations into the discretionary assistance fund, homelessness services and the pupil development grant\u2014[<em>Interruption.</em>] Excuse me, Chair. The cost-of-living crisis and its impact on household budgets means that many people have been unable to pay their rent or other household bills, and, for my portfolio, the risk of them falling into rent arrears and subsequently facing eviction is a real, real concern. We do not want to push individuals towards seeking homelessness support from the local authority; we want them to go into homelessness prevention support, and we want to try to keep people in their homes where at all possible. I'm sure, Chair, that you'll remember from previous sessions with me, and I'm sure you've had evidence from elsewhere, that we continue to have very high levels of presentations for homelessness services right across Wales. So, I'm pleased to say that we have managed to find an additional allocation of \u00a310 million to put into the homelessness budget and to maintain our 'no-one left out' approach to be sure that no-one is forced to sleep rough. The additional funding is going to go into homelessness prevention measures, including where it cannot be prevented to meet the costs of temporary accommodation.I'm sure that the committee is also aware that we've had absolutely no funding commitment from the UK Government for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We funded our supersponsor scheme, including accommodation and wraparound support using funding from Welsh Government reserves, and we continue to support people arriving from Ukraine. We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales. We've committed \u00a320 million to supporting our Ukrainian humanitarian response as well, and that's to ensure that our really hard-pressed local authorities are able to continue offering the services that we've put in place.And then, Chair, I think what I really want the committee to understand is that, obviously, the part that you're looking at from my budget is part of a much bigger MEG, as we call it\u2014the main expenditure group. And so, we've had to look across right across the MEG to balance out how to get through the pain of this budget, and that's the word that has to be used. It's been a really, really, really difficult thing to do, and we've had to look at an enormous number of things that are essential to be able to push our progressive plans forward.So, we continue to outline a vision and our short and medium-term plans, including preventative plans, to push forward the reform. So, we continue, for example, to resource putting our homelessness legislation onto the statute book; we continue to look at embedding the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ways of working across the piece, including transparency and impact reform; we also continue to try to maintain the longer term strategies that we have for things like decarbonisation, for retrofit, and so on, balanced with the real sharp-point crisis that we've been facing and trying to move the money around, so that we're both helping people in the here and now, but also not making it worse for people later on because we've moved that money around. There's no getting away from the fact that it's been a real, real challenge to do so, and, as I say, we've had to look right across the whole expenditure group to do that, and the money has been moved accordingly in an attempt to do that. I'll leave it there. I'm sure that you'll get into some of the specifics, but I want the committee to fully understand the sheer scale of the budget process that we've been going through in order to try and squeeze some of this cost-of-living money out of the budget.\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: Okay, Minister. Thank you very much for that overview and, as you say, we'll be coming on to many of those matters with subsequent questions. Firstly, Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister and members of your office. May I apologise that I can't be there in person? I have personal reasons that mean that I am stuck here in north Wales at the moment. Minister, you mentioned in your opening statement about homelessness. Just in general on that point, do you feel that homelessness services and support services for homelessness are being prioritised in this budget?\n\nJulie James AM: Diolch, Mabon. Yes, absolutely. So, the data shows clearly that demand is increasing. I've just said in my opening remarks that we know that the pressure on homelessness services across Wales hasn't abated and, in some places, has actually increased. We also know that the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing are adding to the drivers that drive people into home loss. We also know that prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address homelessness. So, we're not going to row back on our 'no-one left out' policy, despite the real serious pressures that we've facing. So, recognising those pressures, the prevention budget will increase by \u00a350 million in 2023-24, an additional \u00a310 million more than previously planned, and that takes our investment in homelessness and housing support to over \u00a3207 million next year.&nbsp;In recognition of the support services required to keep people in their homes as well, we increased the housing support grant budget by \u00a340 million in 2021-22 to \u00a3166.763 million, which is a 30 per cent rise. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the incredibly difficult budget pressure that we've had this year\u2014and it has been incredibly difficult\u2014we have managed to maintain that substantial increase in this year's budget, and then going forward into the 2023-24 budget. So, the answer, I suppose, in a nutshell is that there is obviously more that we could do; there's always going to be more we can do in the face of the current cost-of-living pressure. But, I'm very pleased that we've managed to maintain services at the increased level that we were able to put them in, and we've just managed to get another \u00a310 million into homelessness services themselves. We continue to scrutinise the budget every day, I assure you, looking for extra ways to increase money into this essential service.&nbsp;\n\nMabon ap Gwynfor MS: Thank you, Minister, for that response. If I may go to the narrative of the draft budget as I read it and as we saw it back in December, in that narrative, it mentions the effect of low pay and cost of living on the front-line staff of homelessness services. There was an example that 44 per cent of the workforce were unable to pay bills, that 11 per cent of them were unable to pay rent, et cetera. But, this, again, this year, is a flat settlement, compared to\u2014. I accept that you say that you've increased it in previous years, but in the last year, we've seen huge inflation, so this settlement, which is flat, is a real-terms cut in the settlement, which means that we will then see more of the front-line workforce leaving their jobs, and then more pressure on services. So, in considering the targets that we have\u2014you've mentioned some of them\u2014and the fact that we're likely to see more of that workforce leave and unable to do their work, and additional pressure, do you feel that this settlement is fair for that sector in particular?&nbsp;And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you\u2019re putting towards these services that are provided is enough? [Translation should read: And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you're providing is able to go towards these services that are provided by front-line staff?]&nbsp;\n\n"}

The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.&nbsp;\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 1. What steps is the Government taking to support people in Arfon who depend on public transport? OQ59390\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for that question. Working with Gwynedd County Council, the Welsh Government has invested significantly in sustaining and improve bus services for the people of Arfon. New CAF trains are already running on north Wales lines. The north Wales transport commission will propose further improvements when it reports in the autumn.&nbsp;\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: Thank you for the response. Constitunents in many communities in Arfon are entirely reliant on bus services to get to work, and they are deeply concerned about all of the uncertainty around the future of bus services. Some communities go from one crisis to another and are fighting hard to maintain a level of service that is inadequate in the first instance. There are constituents in Gerlan, Llys y Gwynt, Tal-y-bont, Deiniolen, Rhosgadfan, Nebo, and so on and so forth, who are at risk of being totally isolated at important times of the day. Unite the Union is calling on you as a Government to arrange an emergency summit to discuss the bus crisis, to include all key stakeholders. Will you acknowledge the gravity of the situation, and will you please arrange a summit as a matter of urgency?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those points. The problem for people who rely on public transport is that many other people haven't returned to bus or train services since the COVID pandemic. Taxpayers, through the Welsh Government, have provided millions of pounds in additional funding to support public transport, but the funding raised though bus tickets is still much lower, and there is a new reality there that we have to face.The Deputy Minister has already met, last week, with people in this area\u2014the bus companies and members of local authorities and so forth, and, of course, we are continuing to discuss these issues with the unions. The Deputy Minister has heard what the Member has said this afternoon about a summit. If that would be useful, of course, we would be prepared to speak to people in that kind of forum. But discussions are ongoing to plan for the bus services of the future in this new context.\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I support Si\u00e2n Gwenllian in raising this important issue here today. And, First Minister, I'm sure you will recognise also that, during the summer months, north Wales brings in a huge number of visitors, which certainly boost our communities through creating jobs and prosperity. Indeed, your own figures show that north Wales tourism day visits are around 22.7 million every year. And one of the things we desperately need during that peak season is increased provision of public transport. To me, it's unacceptable that parts of north Wales, whilst welcoming those many visitors, are having to work with a skeleton public transport system. It's not fair on the people who live there, as well as the visitors who come to enjoy our part of the world. So, First Minister, I wonder how you will ensure that there is appropriate public transport during the summer months in north Wales as we welcome more people in the summer ahead?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, we do that by continuing to invest in bus services across north Wales, and in the Arfon area, where there is a strong case to do so. So, we continue to fund the key TrawsCymru T2 bus service, linking Bangor, Caernarfon, Porthmadog, Dolgellau and Aberystwyth. The service is due to be re-tendered this year, with a new contract for better services starting in September. And in the direct context of tourism, the Member, I know, will be glad to welcome the funding that has been provided as part of the north Wales metro programme\u2014funding provided to Gwynedd Council to enable them to improve the popular Snowdon Sherpa bus network across the Eryri national park. The result is that, far from a skeleton service, there are now more accessible buses operating across the area seven days a week, linking key towns and visitor attractions, and that's a step change in provision for residents and visitors alike.\n\nCarolyn Thomas MS: First Minister, would you agree that the Tory UK Government is directing a managed decline of the railways in Wales, while Welsh Government is trying to improve services? Having failed to invest in improving our network or give us consequential funding, they are now making performances worse by forcing Network Rail to actively plan a five-year decline, with more real-term cuts in funding, from 2024 to 2027, which is a huge concern. It could take the rail network 10 to 15 years to recover from this setback.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Carolyn Thomas for that very important supplementary question, because it will certainly affect people in Arfon who depend on public transport, because the UK Government, having failed to invest in improving our rail network over many years, are now actively planning to worsen the performance of the rail network under its own control. Network Rail's asset management plans for the next five-year period offer Wales the second worst funding settlement of anywhere in the United Kingdom. There will be a cash-terms reduction, let alone a real-terms reduction, in an era of rampant inflation\u2014there will be a cash-terms reduction in funding available to Network Rail in Wales over the five years from 2024 to 2029. Network Rail's own plan points to an increase in infrastructure failures in Wales and deteriorating assets, which will cause services to be less reliable and less likely to run on time. That is what the UK Government is planning to happen in Wales, and Carolyn Thomas is absolutely right to point to it as an essential context in which the efforts of the Welsh Government to support public transport here has to take place.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: 2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the future of the provision of apprenticeships in the construction sector? OQ59414\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the Welsh Government is committed to working with employers and our contracted providers to increase apprentice provision across the construction sector and ensure that apprentices are trained to the highest possible standard.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you for that. It's good to hear that you have committed to working with providers and private companies that do provide these opportunities, because some of those have been in touch with me, expressing great disappointment that it's now not possible to offer level 2 apprenticeships for those who want to follow a career in civil engineering. Now, the entry standards for a level 3 apprenticeship requires a C and a D at GCSE level, where, of course, under level 2, the same requirement didn't exist. Now, the result of that is that it does exclude many people who would have gone on to follow prosperous careers in these sectors. It also places more burden on the providers, the construction companies and the civil engineering companies that provide these opportunities, and some of them tell me that, as a result, they wouldn't be eager to continue. So, can I ask the Government to reconsider this decision, because perhaps on the face of it it might look like a sensible step, but, on a practical level, it will have a negative impact?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I've heard the concerns expressed by some companies in north Wales, but we have reformed the qualifications regime under the leadership of employers in the sector. It was they who suggested the new system that we have, and they have done so because they are of the view that the new system will help the recruitment of apprentices who can complete their training successfully and who bring the practical skills needed to work in the sector. That's the intention behind the new system\u2014to help the sector with people emerging from colleges to complete apprenticeships with the skills that they can use successfully. And the problem in terms of recruiting people at level 2 is that evidence shows that they don't, on the whole, do everything that they need to do to be successful in the sector. However, people in the colleges and in the system in north Wales have heard the concerns of some employers up in north Wales, and the Construction Industry Training Board\u2014the board that pulls people together\u2014is going to speak to those companies to see whether there is anything we can do to respond to the problems that they feel that they face.&nbsp;\n\nPaul Davies AM: First Minister, I'm sure you'll agree with me that we need to increase the level of apprenticeships in the construction sector in all parts of Wales, and I'm hopeful that the recent free-port announcement, which is a great example of Governments working together in Wales's best interests, will provide some momentum to provide more opportunities in my constituency and, indeed, across west Wales. Therefore, can you tell us what discussions are taking place with stakeholders to ensure that apprenticeships and, indeed, other vocational skills courses are being made available as part of the free-port programme in Wales?&nbsp;\n\n"}

You'll remember that we received evidence from the Minister at the end of the spring term, and we will be hearing from her again at the end of this first stage. But, before us today we have two academics who I'm sure are going to contribute to the scrutiny work, and therefore I welcome Dr Victoria Jenkins, associate professor in law with Swansea University, and Professor Enda Hayes, who is a professor of air quality and carbon management in the University of the West of England. A very warm welcome to you both and thank you for joining us. We'll go straight to questions, and I know that Janet Finch-Saunders wants to ask the first question. Thank you.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning, bore da. Is the Bill, as currently drafted, sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in air quality in Wales and soundscapes? And if not, why not?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: Do you want&nbsp;to go first?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: A nice easy question to start. So, air quality and the challenge of dealing with air quality is not new. Since the Environment Act 1995, which is 25 years ago, we've been trying to address this challenge and, to be very honest, we have fundamentally failed. We're very good at diagnosing the problem; we're just not very good at solving it. Now, there are elements of this Bill that I think are going to have a fundamental effect, a positive effect on that challenge. Part of the issues around the Environment Act was the wording of the Act\u2014that you had to work in 'pursuit' of the air quality objectives. We now have got stronger language saying that we have to 'secure' them. So, that's good. Updating of the strategy on a more regular basis, evidence-based targets I think are all really, really positive steps. The bit that worries me is I get a tone from the Bill that we're almost starting from scratch, and we're not. We've got 25-30 years of evidence behind us, which means, I think, we can be a lot more ambitious in terms of the timelines, the targets and how we are going to get there. So, it's Marmite for me at the moment, because there are some bits that I think are really, really good and will solve a lot of the issues and will help us progress in terms of addressing the problems, but it just feels like we can do more.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. And we'll come on to some of those individual issues, I'm sure. Dr Jenkins.\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: My interest in this Bill is in relation to how we balance, and my interest generally in terms of environmental law is how we create that balance between giving policy makers and giving Government the discretion to take action to achieve something, but at the same time ensuring accountability. So, that's where I think law may have done us a disservice in the past, and that, moving forward, we need more innovative approaches in that respect. And, from that perspective, I think there are, again, some good bits of this Bill, which are really attempting to put into place a robust framework. I should say I've been an environmental academic lawyer for over 20 years, but I don't specialise in air quality law specifically, so I'm less familiar with the science, but that's why Professor Hayes is here. So, I would say it makes it a little bit trickier for me to talk about the ambition of the Bill in those circumstances, but I'm here to discuss the framework and how it sits today in terms of that balance between discretionary powers and accountability.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Excellent. We will indeed be pursuing some of those points, as well, in a moment, but I'll come to Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I want to go through a specific point right at the outset, which is the scope of the Bill. You touched on the point about starting from scratch. Well, actually, we have various policies in place. One of them is the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013. I declared my interest earlier on there. Now, the active travel group have submitted evidence to this about whether we need to finish some unfinished business that could have been done at the time of the original active travel Act. It's to do with things such as duties to promote active travel, which we've failed to do, et cetera. Now, within the Bill, the Bill addresses two specific, distinct purposes\u2014and my thanks for the briefing note on this\u2014improving air quality, and assessing and managing noise. The cross-party group submission makes the point that Welsh Government state that, in their clean air plan, transport is now the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, predominantly due to emissions from road transport, accounting for approximately one third of emissions, and also, within the explanatory memorandum to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill, it states that our 27 noise maps suggest the homes of more than 200,000 people across Wales are exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organization's 2009 night-noise guidelines, and make the point that the most significant way to deal with this is shifting people away from road use, motorised vehicles, into active travel, walking and cycling, and they suggest some amendments. Have you had time to look at that? Sorry for the extensive preamble, but have you had time to look at that, to express an opinion as to whether you think amendments on active travel would fall within the scope of this Bill? And if you haven't\u2014and I realise you may not\u2014would you be able to go away and have a look at this to see whether you think that those may fall within the scope, because the Llywydd will ultimately have to make a decision on this?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I haven't had a chance to look at it before coming today. I do think that the active travel legislation is significant in the context of air quality and public health, and from my perspective, as an environmental lawyer as well, it's particularly important in bringing together our objectives in Wales in relation to both public health and environmental protection. So, it's certainly, from that perspective, something that I would consider important.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Okay.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I haven't had a chance to look at it either, but what I would say is that when you're looking at solutions, particularly for transport, active travel is essential. You've got to get to that point. I think, for years, we've been very much orientated in our solutions towards technocentric solutions. So, these are cleaner vehicles, cleaner fuels. That will only get us so far; the scale of the problem here means that we have to look at behavioural interventions, which means getting more people out of vehicles, onto bikes, and out of cars. That's a given. There are a lot of things you have to address to get around that: affordability, accessibility, reliability\u2014all those things that come with public transport\u2014and safety issues around active travel infrastructure, things like that. It's essential. If we're going to solve this problem, then we've got to deal with it.The other point that I might add, if I may, is that what we're dealing with here is a public health issue. It's a public health issue. So, if you're looking at active travel interventions, those interventions will have the core benefits of also working towards better public health. So, it isn't just about improving air quality; it's also the benefits you get elsewhere. So, it's essential, in my mind.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Rather than delay the committee, then, Chair\u2014and thank you for those answers; so, in principle, you've got no objection and, in fact, you can see the benefits of it\u2014I wonder if I could, perhaps, be cheeky enough to ask you to go away and look at it, perhaps discuss it with colleagues in law and whatever to see whether you think it falls within the scope of the two aims of this Bill.\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: Okay.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Janet, did you want to come back in on something? And then we'll come back to Huw.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Thank you, Chair. All it was, when we take evidence during the forming of new Bills, quite often, one thing that comes up is that we haven't collected enough data. Now, you say that we look like we're almost at the start again, but a lot of years have gone before. Has the Welsh Government been proactive in collecting the relevant data so that any Bill going forward will be based on really good evidence, if you like?\n\nProfessor Enda Hayes: I can start there. You can always get more data, is the short answer. You can always have more, it can always be better. Across Wales, if we're looking at air quality monitoring data, we've got a pretty extensive network of monitoring sites. I think, from memory, there are about fortyish continuous analysers run by local authorities, and about 10 to 12 analysers connected to the automatic urban and rural network. There's plenty of data already out there. Now, that can always be improved, and I think the tone of the Bill means that we'll have to think differently about how we monitor. So, at the moment, we've monitored for compliance, we've monitored where we've got problematic areas, where we've got these hotspots, where we've got these risks of exceedances. This Bill, again, seems to be more orientated towards prevention, being more proactive\u2014again, the public health side of the issue\u2014which means we have to think differently about how we monitor in terms of understanding public health, and bringing that air quality, health, deprivation triple jeopardy into the equation. So, we've got plenty to start from; we can always have more, and we will have to think differently because the Bill is orientating our approach slightly differently.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Fine.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.\n\nLlyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. Huw.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: Let me come on, then, to ask for your views on the Welsh Government's decision, as it stands, to set air quality targets in regulations rather than on the face of the Bill. And their argument is that this will give greater flexibility to respond to the latest guidance and to futureproof the Bill. Do you have sympathy with that or would you prefer to see air quality targets bang on the face of the Bill?\n\nDr Victoria Jenkins: I think this is a question for me in the sense that, if you say too much on the face of primary legislation like this, then you are impinging your discretion to take action as things proceed and as scientific knowledge and understanding moves on. So, it is often a good idea to create a power to introduce regulations. That said, the issue then becomes, well, to what extent do you give the Government discretion, or the Executive discretion, to bring in those regulations and what's the framework for that. So, currently, there is quite a lot of discretion now given to the Executive in that respect, and that's something that you might want to consider further.\n\n"}

The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Vikki Howells.&nbsp;\n\nVikki Howells AM: 1. How is the Welsh Government working to improve the provision of health services for the people of Cynon Valley? OQ59213\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. A series of national programmes assist the health board in providing improved access to its services. These programmes offer the most up-to-date clinical advice and access to latest best practice so that standards can be improved in all parts of Wales, including the Cynon valley.\n\nVikki Howells AM: Thank you for your answer, First Minister, and I was really pleased to hear the announcement last month about the new diagnostics and treatment centre for south-east Wales, to be based in Rhondda Cynon Taf. This could not just reduce, but actually eliminate, backlogs in accessing treatment and substantially reduce waiting times, moving forward, for orthopedic surgeries in particular, for people in Cynon valley and neighbouring areas.&nbsp;Can you provide any information on timescales for delivery of this key project and, in addition, outline what help Welsh Government will be providing to health boards to get this new centre up and running?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, I thank Vikki Howells for that question, and for drawing attention to that very important development in the RCT area. And, Llywydd, it's a genuine example, I think, of the social partnership approach in Wales in action. The three buildings that are to be used were first identified by the local authority. They drew them to the attention of the health board. The health board had negotiations with the current private sector occupant of the buildings. The health board then involved itself in discussions with the wider south-east Wales health community, and the financial help to acquire the buildings was provided through the Welsh Government. So, there you have local government, the health service, the private sector and the Welsh Government all collectively involved in bringing about a development that, as Vikki Howells said, will lead to significant new capacity for residents in this part of Wales.&nbsp;In terms of timescales, it's important to remember that the building is still occupied by its current owner, but there will be a period over the next 12 months in which they bring their use of the building to an end, and diagnostic capacity, which will be the first phase of the new development, will be worked up by the health board, its partners, including the Welsh Government, and that will be the first phase in the next calendar year. And then, once that is developed, there will be physical space at the buildings to have dedicated elective capacity, with a particular focus on orthopaedic care, which will, as Vikki Howells said, Llywydd, make an important difference to patients in that part of Wales, in accelerating their access to treatment. And the Welsh Government will be there not just with the financial help we've offered so far, but, as I said in my original answer, by making sure that the health board has access to those national programmes, those national clinical leads, which will help to make sure that the most advantage can be derived from this new development.\n\nJoel James MS: First Minister, according to Stats Wales, in December 2022, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which covers the Cynon valley, along with Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and the rest of Rhondda Cynon Taf, had a staggering 13,732 patients waiting more than 14 weeks for diagnostic and therapy services, out of a population of 450,000. This represents 36 per cent of the total amount of people waiting more than 14 weeks in Wales. Cwm Taf health board also had 31,992 patients waiting over eight weeks, which represented 18 per cent of the Welsh total, which is, sadly, further evidence of the postcode lottery that exists in Wales with the health service.&nbsp;To put these figures into perspective, for the same month, the whole of London, which has a population of over nine million people, had a similar amount of 32,953 people waiting more than six weeks. Recent Office for National Statistics data shows that, out of the 331 areas in the United Kingdom, Merthyr Tydfil is officially the sickest place, with almost 10 per cent of the population in very bad health, whilst RCT is sixth and Bridgend is thirteenth. As you know, recent news shows that Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has now been put back into special measures, and the British Dental Association has warned that NHS dentistry in Wales could soon disappear, with the chairman of the BDA's Welsh general committee stating that Welsh NHS dentistry in its current state is unlikely to exist in a year or two's time. With this in mind, First Minister, what steps has the Welsh Government taken to improve on these appalling statistics? Thank you.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, it's being so cheerful that keeps him going, Llywydd\u2014it's certainly not the accuracy of his grasp of the facts. In some ways, the Member managed to answer his own question, eventually, by pointing to the fact that the reason why there are percentages of that sort waiting in Cwm Taf is because of the nature of the population it serves. It's not a postcode lottery at all; it's as the Member eventually managed to say\u2014it is because Cwm Taf Morgannwg serves one of the oldest and sickest populations that we see anywhere in Wales. And the demand for health services reflects the needs of that local population. It's all the better news, therefore, that the development that Vikki Howells pointed to will accelerate access not simply to diagnostic services, but to planned operations for people in that part of Wales.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: 2. What progress has the Welsh Government made on embedding prudent healthcare into every aspect of health and well-being in Cardiff Central? OQ59234\n\nMark Drakeford AM: I thank Jenny Rathbone for that question. Llywydd, value-based healthcare continues to take forward the prudent healthcare principles of ill-health prevention, joint partnership with patients on the journey to improvement, and diversification of the workforce so that every practitioner operates at the top of their clinical licence.\n\nJenny Rathbone AM: First Minister, I'm sure you will want to celebrate the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, mindful of the well-being of their staff, and inviting them to take part in courses on how to grow vegetables on the Llandough hospital site, obviously funded by the Cardiff and Vale health board charity\u2014something, I'm sure, close to both our hearts. But I also want to highlight their recent work on tackling the enduring epidemic of mental illness. Referrals to secondary care remain almost as high as they were during the pandemic. So, they've been training barbers to recognise signs of mental distress amongst their customers, and they're training people with lived experience of enduring mental health problems as tutors, to work alongside professional clinical tutors, involving individual patients and families and friends in a whole-system recovery, through something called the recovery college. How can this really creative response to the shortage of applicants to fill staff vacancies be deepened across Government, to help shrink the disparity in the numbers of years lived well between different socioeconomic groups, so harshly exposed by COVID? In Cardiff, it's 12 years.\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, I thank Jenny Rathbone for that. I certainly share her enthusiasm for the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, at their Llandough site, in using the ground that they have available there for well-being initiatives. The fruit that is being grown in part of the western edge of that site offers patients as well as people who work for the health board an opportunity to be outside, in the fresh air, and with access to the things that we know improve individuals' sense of well-being.As far as the mental health impact of the pandemic is concerned, it continues to be seen in all parts of Wales. The Welsh Government's new investment in mental health is often very much concentrated in that prudent healthcare part of the spectrum: investment in tier 0 and tier 1 services, and the 111 'press 2' service that's available 24 hours every day in the Cardiff and Vale health board area, and with a publicity campaign, Llywydd, which will take place throughout this month, to increase patients' awareness and use of that very valuable service. I'm very struck by what the Member said, Llywydd, about the way in which it is possible to harness the efforts of people who aren't in the health service at all to be part of the work of identifying and attending to patients needs as early as possible when those needs arise. I do recall, some years ago now, when I was health Minister, visiting Pen-y-groes, a Welsh-speaking area in the Ammanford coalfield, to see a dementia service and being told by the GPs who ran it that their most important source of referrals were hairdressers on the main street of the village, because those hairdressers knew their clientele\u2014they could spot the person who wasn't quite managing as well as they used to, with the money, with the organisation, and they would make an early referral into the dementia service, so that people could get that preventative intervention that is possible when you manage to identify people early on that journey. The barbers in Cardiff, the postal workers in Cardiff, who we know have those day in, day out interactions on the doorstep, all these are people who we can make helpful to the health service in that prudent healthcare way.&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, last week, my colleague Janet Finch-Saunders, along with other MSs, hosted a meeting about the cladding situation here in Wales, and the Welsh Cladiators, who have been pioneering the lobbying work and the projection of the plight of many home owners here in Wales who are caught up in this, really should be commended by all Members in this Chamber. One of the asks among many was why isn't the Welsh Government coming forward and adopting the legislation that has been put down in England, to take sections 116 and 125, to give rights to leaseholders so that they themselves can exercise those rights in holding the developers to account. I've heard Mike Hedges, one of your backbenchers, speak in favour of this in the Chamber when speaking to the leader of the house. There's cross-party support for this. We had a debate prior to Christmas. Will the Government reconsider its view, in light of the ongoing crisis that many home owners here in Wales face?&nbsp;\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Well, Llywydd, first of all, I join with the leader of the opposition in congratulating those people who continue to campaign on this issue to make sure that the Welsh Government is always aware of developments that they are in touch with and that their views are conveyed to us. And I know that last week's meeting was an opportunity for that to happen, and the Minister will be following that up in her forthcoming meeting with the strategic safety stakeholder group, where these matters can be further debated, and the Minister keeps all those arguments about sections 118 to section 125 under review.The position, though, is that those regulations\u2014those sections\u2014were specifically written for the building safety regime in England. It is not as simple as simply picking them up and dropping them into the very different Welsh context. And there are some disadvantages for leaseholders who find themselves within that regime, because here in Wales our intention is that leaseholders should not be required to pay for the remedial action that is required to their buildings, whereas those sections expose leaseholders to bills up to \u00a310,000, and we don't intend to do that in Wales. So, while we will continue to keep the position under close review, we're not convinced that a simple drag-and-drop of those sections into the Welsh context would deliver what the campaigners say it would deliver, and we're not convinced that it could not actually act to their detriment.&nbsp;\n\n"}

And let me welcome our witnesses joining us in person today. From the left, as I look at our witnesses, we have&nbsp;Gareth Wilson, who is a Celestia leaseholder; Mark Thomas, also at Celestia and a member of Welsh Cladiators; Robert Nicholls, from Altamar Swansea and founder of Swansea Cladiators and a member of the Welsh Cladiators; and Geoff Spight, Altamar in Swansea also, and also a member of the Welsh Cladiators. Welcome to you all\u2014croeso. Let me begin with one or two initial questions before we move to other members of the committee. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Oh, yes, sorry, you are making a presentation initially, aren't you? I'm sorry. Who will present to us?\n\nMark Thomas: I will, Chair. And could I just confirm the timing, because I know you have a very busy agenda?\n\nJohn Griffiths AM: We have one hour in total for this evidence session, but a brief presentation to begin with is absolutely fine.\n\nMark Thomas: Sure, okay. So, first of all, diolch,&nbsp;thank you very much for your time. We realise you're very busy. We very much appreciate the opportunity of appearing before you. We would like to just make a quick presentation to give an overview of where we think we are now, because we remain deeply concerned about the slow progress that we're making in Wales on this crisis.However, in addition to thanking yourself, I'd also like to thank and make a public thanks to our colleagues in the Welsh fire and rescue services, because, in our view, they've been magnificent in supporting us over the last few years and, to some extent, as we'll come on to, they are also a victim of this crisis in terms of the pressure and workload that has been put on them, but we'd like to express our gratitude and thanks for their professionalism and support.The key thing I think that we want to emphasise today is the need for urgency with regard to this crisis. I think by now we'll know that on 14 June of this year it will be six years since the Grenfell tragedy. Six years is an awfully long time, and we remain deeply concerned about the slow rate of progress in Wales. And with that in mind, we recognise that none of us want to be here today. I'm supposed to be retired, Gareth has retired, and we have a lot of different victims caught up in this crisis. We're also clearly of the view that the crisis is not of our making, it's not of the making of the people that we propose to represent, and neither do we think it's the making of the Welsh Government. Developers and builders created this problem. But, at the same time, one of our concerns is that there seems to be a lack of understanding of the impact that this crisis is having on many hundreds of decent, ordinary people who did the right thing. They worked hard to prepare often for, like myself, a pension, to get on the housing ladder et cetera, et cetera, and they had surveys done, they bought what they thought were effective properties, and they've turned out to be disasters.And the range of victims, as you can see, is very, very high. We have pensioners whose pension plans&nbsp;are in turmoil, we have many young people. I know, in some blocks, people have had to move on, because they're trying to start a family; they need to move in order to change careers or jobs, and they're stuck. So, there are many different victims of this crisis. And I want to remind you here\u2014if I can just refer to this, because I can't see your screen; too far away\u2014that this was a letter sent from a leaseholder I know. He's in his mid to late 70s. He's a retired teacher who has done everything correct in his life, and he and his wife live just four minutes away from here, and this is a letter they wrote to Julie James back in December 2020 about the effect the crisis was having on their life. And personally, I know this gentleman; I'm not going to name him, because I don't want to embarrass him, but I have seen physically in his face and his mental condition the impact that the worry that this crisis has had. And just as that gentleman in 2020 urged Julie James to recognise that, we think that is being lost in this whole issue\u2014the human cost. And one of the fundamental problems that we think is at play here is that, as I'm sure many of you know, the corporate entity is a very tough animal. It only understands two things: it responds to the law of the land and profit erosion. And profit erosion is often competitor activity, customers moving away or Government regulation. And it's quite clear that developers have been incredibly profitable over the last decade or two in the United Kingdom, and there's a figure there\u2014they've made profits equalling \u00a331 billion in the last 10 years. So, these are people who can afford to repair our fire and build-defective homes. It's not a question of the Government needing to fund this; developers have the money to fund it.But the problem we have\u2014and we've lived this now, or I've lived this, almost seven days a week for the last four years\u2014is the corporate leadership of the companies involved. Their salaries are not based on responding to our needs. They only respond to the force of law, and I'd like to come back to that, because that's a key issue and concern we have about how we're currently approaching the problem in Wales, as opposed to the actions that are being taken in England. And just to illustrate that\u2014I won't go through every one of these\u2014it is concerning that, in recent times, the Minister, Julie James, has repeatedly thanked and commended developers for signing her pact and co-operating. And we get a lot of very positive words from developers, and you'll see down in the bottom right hand\u2014I think this comes, maybe, Gareth, from the pact or the pledge\u2014it talks about working in 'Good Faith', 'Work Constructively', 'No Liability', 'At Pace', 'Be Assured', 'As quickly as reasonably possible' and 'Within one month deliver a proposal'. And we have this very stark contrast between people using a lot of nice positive rhetoric and their feet moving in a different direction. So, at the same time that Richard Akers, the chairman of Redrow, is saying lots of positive things, I and my own development are in deep litigation with that company, which we don't want to be involved in. So, our whole approach is that, for years, developers have obfuscated and deflected responsibility for this crisis. The only thing that makes them move is legislation, and that's quite key. And I'd also\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Yes.\n\nGareth Wilson: If I could just make one comment while we've got this slide up, because it's a very interesting thing. But, in those quotes that Mark just ran through, which come from the pact and pledge, which are identical, essentially, the last one has an actual date or time in it: 'Within one month deliver a proposal', and that is the one thing that has not happened. The one concrete date that was in there simply has not happened. Sorry, Mark\u2014carry on.\n\nMark Thomas: Again, our concern is, at the moment, that in recent weeks, the Minister has been praising the likes of Taylor Wimpey and Bellway, but we know from on the ground that Taylor Wimpey are not engaging and communicating effectively with leaseholders in Victoria Wharf, Cardiff. And you will know that Victoria Wharf has had some three, thankfully, very minor fire incidents in the last six months or so. And we also know that if you go across the bay to Prospect Place, where Bellway are involved, they were apparently undertaking some remediation work, but their contractor has now gone bankrupt, or there's some other corporate crisis, and they've ceased working. So, again, we have this contrast between lofty rhetoric and the reality of what is actually happening on the ground. And there's a disconnect there that we think needs to be addressed.\n\n"}

Welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Finance and Local Government. The first question today is from Hefin David.\n\nHefin David AM: 1. What assessment has the Welsh Government made of the potential impact of increasing the basic rate of income tax in Wales? OQ59146\n\nRebecca Evans AM: Raising the basic rate would add additional costs on those less able to afford it at a time when the UK Government has frozen income tax thresholds, dragging lower earners into the income tax system.\n\nHefin David AM: I think the key point made by the Minister there is that, at the time, I think income tax is something that should be revisited in the future, but she's absolutely right to say that this is not the time for it. Last week, we saw an amendment to the Welsh Government's budget by Plaid Cymru that would have cost people on the basic rate \u00a32.47 a week extra, during a cost-of-living crisis. Personally, my view is that the co-operation agreement should not have allowed that amendment to be put, given that it covers the budget, and it was disappointing to see that that happened outside the co-operation agreement. We should see Plaid Cymru taking responsibility for the power they have in the Senedd Chamber. Would the Minister be willing, though, to review this position in the future, should economic circumstances allow at some point?\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I'm very grateful to Hefin David for the question, and for raising Welsh rates of income tax this afternoon. And I completely agree with his assessment that it is not the right time, in a cost-of-living crisis, to be asking those who are on the absolute lowest incomes, and indeed those who have been drawn into the income tax system for the very first time, to be paying more. And I think it's well established that, to raise any serious amount of money in order to boost the resources that we have, we would be required to raise the basic rate of income tax. I do think that it has to be done in a considered and strategic way. That said, every single year, we do assess our options, in terms of how we use the Welsh rates of income tax, and we would expect to look afresh again at this issue next year, both in terms of people's overall tax burden and contribution, depending on where things are with the UK Government, and, of course, the wider economic situation that people find themselves in. But, absolutely, it's something that we consider afresh for every budget.\n\nTom Giffard MS: As we heard from Hefin David there, one of the perils of increasing income tax at a time of financial trouble is the fact that it would be something built on the back of working people across Wales. And it's quite apt, I think, on the day that Nicola Sturgeon resigned as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland, to remember exactly where Plaid Cymru got this idea from, because they devolve a lot of their thinking out to a party from another part of the United Kingdom\u2014the SNP. Because, in Scotland, they're proposing to add 1p onto the higher and top rates of tax, alongside reducing the top rate threshold, from \u00a3150,000 to just over \u00a3125,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that that will spark an exodus of high earners across the border. Scottish business leaders have branded it a disadvantage for Scotland and made clear that it would make competing with the UK for talent much harder. On top of those increases, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has not ruled out a 10 per cent hike in council taxes there. In a survey, half of all Scots wanted the current system of council tax to end. Another survey showed that one in five Scottish households are currently living in serious financial difficulty, equivalent to 1.2 million people; in the UK overall, it's 17 per cent. That's Plaid's vision for Wales, Minister, and it's a vision that's built on the back of taxing working people. Do you agree with me that that's a totally wrong priority, at the wrong time, from a party that is increasingly out of touch with the people of Wales?\n\nRebecca Evans AM: Well, I would gently remind the Member that, under the UK Conservative Government, the tax burden on people in Wales, and across the UK, is now at a 70-year high as a result of the decisions that that Government has made. But I do think that Scottish rates of income tax are very much a matter for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament, but that doesn't mean that we can't learn from their experiences, which is why we're very interested in the work that HMRC is progressing in terms of developing a longitudinal data set. Now, that hopefully will allow us to have some more detailed analysis of the behavioural impacts of tax changes, including migration responses, and my officials are in frequent contact with HMRC to better understand the possibilities that that work might release.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: 2. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Climate Change and the Minister for Social Justice regarding Welsh Government support to ease the financial pressures on scheduled bus services? OQ59129\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I regularly engage with my Cabinet colleagues on funding issues. In this financial year, we have made available over \u00a3110 million of funding to protect and grow bus services right across Wales. The bus emergency scheme has also been extended into the next financial year.&nbsp;\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies AM: It's undoubtedly the case, Minister, that cross-Government working, finding the money to put in place the emergency bus support and also extending it now for the next few months has been critical to ensuring the survival of the bus industry in Wales, including independent operators, small family operators and so on that run their businesses. But we know the pressures that your budget is under, but we also do know that this is genuinely a climate justice issue, and it's also a social justice issue, as we keep being told, quite rightly. And we can repeat this endlessly until it gets into people's minds that 80 per cent of those people who use buses have no other alternative. So, can I simply urge\u2014this is not asking for magic money\u2014but can I genuinely urge her, in her discussions with the Minister for Climate Change, and the Minister for Social Justice and Cabinet colleagues, to do all she possibly can to try and find that way that we can keep these bus services going in all our communities\u2014rural and urban Wales. It's vital, going forward, particularly after the announcement yesterday about turning a corner a different way to deal with shifting people to more sustainable travel.&nbsp;\n\nRebecca Evans AM: I'm grateful for the question and completely agree with the points that are made about bus services being a critical part of our approach to delivering social justice here in Wales, and, of course, an important part of our environmental aspirations as well. I think that our support for the bus industry through the pandemic and now at the other side of the pandemic has been absolutely crucial in terms of maintaining the services that we do have in Wales. But it was a bus emergency scheme, and I think that this level of subsidy is just not sustainable in the long term, which is really why we are looking at reviewing the bus services support grant, to move the industry away from that kind of reliance on the emergency funding to something that is much more stable in the future. And colleagues will be aware of our ambitious plans, in terms of the bus Bill that we aim to bring forward, to bring more control back to local authorities in terms of the services that are provided. So, I think that, really, is the longer term answer, but, in the meantime, our support is really important for the industry.&nbsp;\n\nAltaf Hussain MS: Minister, I have raised on a number of occasions the plight of residents across my region who have suffered as the result of cuts to scheduled bus services.&nbsp;The most recent issue brought to my attention is a proposal by First Cymru to cut services to Resolven in my region.&nbsp;Many people in Resolven, particularly the elderly, are dependent upon the X7 service, as their nearest post office or bank is over seven miles away. Any reduction in service will have a bad impact on a community like Resolven.&nbsp;I have also been contacted by Neath Port Talbot Council, who are concerned that the Welsh Government\u2019s decision to axe bus emergency scheme 3 funding is leading to the acceleration in cuts to these bus services. If BES3 funding goes, companies operating services within Port Talbot and Neath will deregister most routes within the county borough. Minister, will you reconsider the decision to end BES3 funding and look at other ways to support a struggling bus industry that is so vital to many of our constituents?\n\n"}

The first item on the agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is to be answered by the Deputy Minister, and to be asked by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: 1. What plans does the Welsh Government have in place to help the young people of Arfon with the costs of traveling on public transport? OQ59096\n\nLee Waters AM: Diolch. One of the aims of 'Llwybr Newydd', the Wales transport strategy, is to reduce the cost of sustainable travel for everyone in Wales, including young people. We are working towards an accessible transport system across the nation and have a number of initiatives aimed at younger travellers.\n\nSi\u00e2n Gwenllian AM: It's good to hear that there are plans in the pipeline, and, of course, we need to extend them and to bring new plans forward too. But in rural parts of my constituency, it's not the cost of travelling on buses that's the only problem. There's a lack of bus services in the first instance, with some communities without a way to travel at all at times, because there are no trains, metro, appropriate cycling routes, nor are there bus services at some times of the day. Now, Yr Orsaf in Penygroes is developing a project to support residents, including young people, who face barriers because of a lack of public transport in dyffryn Nantlle, with the support of the dyffryn Nantlle community transport partnership. Is community transport an area that you as a Deputy Minister want to see developing in the future, and, if this is a priority for you, how much funding has been earmarked for encouraging this kind of transport in the Government's draft budget for the next financial year?\n\nLee Waters AM: Thank you. A number of points there. I'm familiar with the work of Partneriaeth Ogwen and have visited some of their schemes\u2014they're an outstanding organisation. I was particularly struck by the scheme we've been funding them for to retrofit bicycles, to add a battery to them, which, particularly in rural areas, particularly hilly areas, is a really practical thing that we can do to help people who don't have easy access to a car or to public transport. We know that, for generations, we've been favouring investment into road schemes, for those people who have cars, and, over time, have been neglecting public transport, and we've seen usage decline, we've seen routes shrink and we've seen fares go up. So, that is one of the reasons why we're bringing forward our bus Bill, to redesign the service, and it's one of the reasons why we'll be publishing the roads review next Tuesday, to, over time, shift resource from car-based schemes to schemes for everyone.In the meantime, we do have some really difficult financial challenges, and we are seeing bus schemes being withdrawn, which illustrates the problem we have with the privatised system, because there is no strategic overview to this\u2014it's being done randomly by bus companies. And then, we have the further problem, particularly in rural Wales, where bus companies are struggling to keep their business model going, and the cost of energy is really stopping them being able to run routes, and they're not tendering for fresh services. So, we have a range of challenges facing us, but the fundamental problem is the lack of investment that we have. Because we have prioritised other things, including as part of the co-operation agreement. We could have chosen to prioritise public transport; we chose other things, and we have to do the best we can with what we've got. But, clearly, as part of our modal shift and the net-zero targets, we need to shift resource far more into public transport.\n\nSam Rowlands MS: I just want to echo the comments raised by the Member for Arfon, and recognise that this important focus is required on public transport, especially for rural areas, in areas like Arfon and across north Wales\u2014the region I represent, of course. Deputy Minister, I'm sure you are an avid reader of the Welsh Conservative manifesto, especially the one for the 2021 Senedd elections. In that, we as Conservatives called for free bus travel and discounted rail travel for 16 to 24-year-olds, to help our young people access education, training and employment. This of course could embed that modal shift that you and I are so keen to see, whilst also supporting our environment, so importantly. So, in light of this, Minister, what consideration have you and the Welsh Government given to this type of idea, to see that free access to buses for our young people, so we can see that modal shift whilst also supporting our environment? Thank you very much.\n\nLee Waters AM: Well, there's no doubt that, if we had lower prices, we'd have higher use. There are schemes right across the world, including free bus use in Normandy and elsewhere, and free bus schemes in Wales, in Cardiff and Swansea and Newport, for short periods, which have shown an uptake in usage. So, we know that, when fares drop, people are more likely to use it. There's no shortage of opportunities and ideas to increase usage and to reduce fares, and incentivise people to use public transport. The challenge always is the resource. So, I'm not sure how the Conservatives plan to fund that initiative that they had in their manifesto, but there are no easy options that I'm aware of to do just that.We do have an offer on buses where people aged between 16 and 21 have a third off an adult bus ticket, and we've been doing a lot of work, as part of our commitment to a fairer fares regime, to model what we could achieve if we had much lower bus fares. And the figures are all very encouraging; the resource is the challenge.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: 2. What support is the Welsh Government providing for coastal communities facing the threat of flooding? OQ59079\n\nJulie James AM: Thank you, Janet. The Welsh Government is investing \u00a3293 million in reducing flood risk to coastal communities across Wales through our coastal risk management programme. This will reduce flood risk to over 15,000 properties, and includes, for example, more than \u00a319 million of investment in Aberconwy. An interactive map showing our investment is published online.\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Minister. I'm sure you're aware that, in 2014, our lovely sandy beach, north shore, Llandudno, received, without any notice, the dumping of some 50,000 tonnes of freshly and dirty quarried rock. At the time, it was described as 'shingle'. The town was in uproar, with residents, visitors and business owners still angry to this day. I can recall our sea washing up a white, milky froth for around three weeks, whilst this was described at the time as 'clean and inert shingle.'&nbsp;Now, in 2023\u2014well, sooner than that, actually\u2014we're now aware of the several options that have been brought forward to you to bring forward a new sea water flood defence scheme. One of the options is to implement a scheme that would replace sand, and stage 1 was even supported. I cannot overemphasise my immense disappointment that this scheme now will not be supported, as you feel that the cost outweighs the aesthetic benefits of using sand renourishment. Llandudno is the queen of the Welsh resorts, and the jewel in the crown\u2014&nbsp;\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: I'm going to have to call you to ask your question now, because I'm about to ask you to ask your spokespeople questions, of which there are three. So, can you ask your question?\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What steps, Minister, can you take? How do we move forward on this? What steps will you take to ensure that we have the right sea defences we need, but that, at some stage, we can see our sandy beach restored in Llandudno? Diolch.&nbsp;\n\nJulie James AM: Yes, thank you, Janet. So, just to be really specific, the Welsh Government have recently awarded grant funding to Conwy County Borough Council to develop a full business case for Llandudno, based on maintaining and improving the existing cobble defence on the north shore. The alternative sand option provides no additional flood benefit, at a much greater cost to the coastal risk management programme, and that's the problem. So, whilst I completely understand what you're saying about the sandy beach, the coastal risk management programme is for coastal risk management; it's not for tourist attractions and other aesthetic value. I'm not denying the value of that; I'm just saying that's not what the programme is for.&nbsp;So, if Conwy County Borough Council want to get an alternative sand option at Llandudno north shore, they really need to look for alternative sources of funding. There are some other sources of funding available, but, in all conscience, I cannot take a coastal management programme that's specifically designed to protect places from flooding and use it for a completely different purpose. So, whilst I have some sympathy with what you're saying, this is not the right programme for it. And, you can tell from the amount of money that we've invested around the coast of Wales that we are really trying to get as many properties protected from actual flooding as possible. Clearly, we do try to do that in the most environmentally and aesthetically pleasing way possible, but, in the end, it's down to how many properties we protect. So, I'm sure you'll be able to work with the council to get a better option, but not through this funding model.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Janet Finch-Saunders.&nbsp;\n\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Diolch, Llywydd, and thank you, Minister, Now, there is no denying that the UK Government is taking decisive action to tackle unsafe buildings. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP has sent all developers legally binding contracts that will commit them to pay to repair these unsafe buildings. This contract will see developers commit an estimated \u00a32 billion or more for repairs to buildings that they've developed or refurbished over the past 30 years, and protect thousands of leaseholders living in hundreds of buildings across England.&nbsp;In England, the UK Government is looking to prevent developers from operating freely in the housing market if they fail to sign and comply with the remediation contract. Will you do the same for those operating in Wales who either refuse to sign or breach the terms of the Welsh Government's developers pact?\n\n"}

The first item this afternoon will be the emergency question that I have accepted under Standing Order 12.67. The question will be answered by the Minister for Social Justice, and is to be asked by Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: What discussions is the Welsh Government having with South Wales Police regarding riots in Cardiff over the last 24 hours? (EQ0010)\n\nJane Hutt AM: Thank you for that question. This is a tragic incident. My thoughts are with all affected. While South Wales Police urgently investigate the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. I would call for calm and for people to support the police and other agencies involved in supporting the local community.&nbsp;\n\nAndrew RT Davies AM: Thank you, Minister, for that response to the original question, and can I endorse the comments that you made about calm, and dealing with the facts that relate to this particularly tragic incident? And our thoughts and prayers are, obviously, with the family of the two individuals, as I understand it, who sadly have lost their lives in a road traffic accident.&nbsp;There can be no excuse for the violence we witnessed last night on our tv screens and social media output, but what I would ask of the Welsh Government is: what assessment has been made by the Welsh Government, along with its partner agencies, of the strength of community cohesion in the area of Ely in Cardiff, and in particular the ability of those agencies to respond and work positively and proactively with the community to build the opportunities, install hope in communities, and ultimately make sure that residents in this part of Cardiff do not have to tolerate this level of lawlessness? And will you support me in wishing that the agencies of the law bring forward anyone they can identify, so that the full force of the law can be brought against them to make sure that there is no repetition of these scenes that we saw on our screens last night?\n\nJane Hutt AM: Well, I thank Andrew R.T. Davies for that supplementary question. I was shocked and saddened, as I'm sure we all are today, to hear of the tragic death of two young people involved in a serious road traffic collision in the Ely area of Cardiff yesterday evening, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the two young people involved.&nbsp;But I would like to take the opportunity, along with the points that you've made, to thank all those services, and, indeed, the community itself\u2014all those services involved, of health, police, the local authority, fire and rescue services\u2014for the exemplary way they pulled together to handle the situation. And I think it is a reflection of the excellent community safety partnership work that's been done in that part of Cardiff, focusing on it last night. It enabled those services to work together so well in this fast-moving and tragic situation.&nbsp;I do understand that South Wales Police have made arrests in connection with the disorder, and that more will follow, but, clearly, this is something where our thoughts are also with the community\u2014such a warm and strong community. And I know, obviously, that the local authority, our colleagues and elected representatives, and the leader of the council, were all engaged in this. And I was listening to the phone-in with Jason Mohammed\u2014of course, from the Ely area\u2014who actually interviewed the Rev&nbsp;Jan Gould from the Church of the Resurrection. It's a strong community in Ely, and we must remember this as we look to follow up and hear, obviously, what has happened, what the circumstances were surrounding this tragic series of events.&nbsp;\n\nHeledd Fychan MS: May I thank Andrew R.T. Davies for putting in this question, and thank you, Minister, for the response? As you mentioned, there is an ongoing investigation, but may I echo the comments made in terms of sharing our deepest, deepest sympathy with the families of the victims, and their friends, of course, and, as you say, the community? Because it is a community, a very strong community, and I know many people are devastated by what happened last night, and the subsequent violence as well. And people are terrified, saying that they are still worried that this could escalate further. And what I would want to ask is: what discussions have taken place to provide reassurance to those in the community that suffered last night\u2014they were terrified in their homes\u2014and, obviously, to deal with the tragic loss of two young people as well?Can I ask also in terms of what seems to be that breakdown in community police relations as well, in terms of miscommunication? We've heard that there may have been miscommunication on social media that led to this. Well, there was absolutely no communication with me as one of the five Senedd Members for the area, to find out anything about what happened or to provide any reassuring messages, and I've still not received any messages. I think there is a role for us as Senedd Members to play in terms of community cohesion, and I would ask the Welsh Government to ensure that all elected Members receive that assurance from South Wales Police, so that we are able to support that message that you have rightly made in terms of peace for the community, but also support to rebuild.\n\nJane Hutt AM: Diolch yn fawr, Heledd Fychan, and thank you for your words of support and sympathy to the families and to all of those who have been affected by this in the community of Ely. I just want to say that I've already met with the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales, Alun Michael, for an update on this incident, and the First Minister has also been briefed. South Wales Police are looking into exactly what happened, the circumstances surrounding this tragic series of events. And, I have to say, it was a fast-moving situation; I think we were only becoming aware, and I know that the local councillors and the police and all the agencies were working to address the situation, as it emerged. Again, I would want to thank those who responded so quickly and speedily to this. In fact, the violent disorder that took place did include attacks on the emergency services, damage to property, causing considerable fear, as you've said, within the community, which is completely unacceptable. So, can I again call for calm and for people to support the police and other services in the work that's being undertaken now? And, of course, in terms of communications, I'm pleased to be responding to this question this afternoon, and we will keep everyone briefed in terms of the ongoing investigation.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: Thank you, Minister, for those responses and for taking the question.\n\nY Llywydd / The Llywydd: The next item, therefore, will be our usual first item of questions to the First Minister. The first question is from Hefin David.\n\nHefin David AM: 1. Will the First Minister provide an update on Welsh Government support with the cost of school uniform for learners and their families? OQ59582\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Llywydd, the Welsh Government is clear that the cost of school uniform should not be a barrier to learning. Our updated uniform guidance requires schools to prioritise affordability. Funding of \u00a313.6 million has been made available for the school essentials grant for 2023-24 to help reduce concerns around purchase of school uniform and equipment for lower income families.\n\nHefin David AM: Diolch, Prif Weinidog. All of those measures put in by the Welsh Government are very welcome. And in complement to that, in Lansbury Park in Caerphilly, Lisa Watkins runs the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange, whereby people can visit to exchange uniforms, to pick up uniforms, and, the most important thing to know, they're open to everyone\u2014regardless of income, you are welcome to go along and use the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange. I'd like perhaps to invite the Minister for education, Jeremy Miles, to come and visit the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange and come and see what's happening. There are similar groups across Wales. Would the First Minister, therefore, as I welcome the Government's policy, also welcome the work that is being done by Lisa Watkins and the volunteers there in Lansbury Park?\n\nMark Drakeford AM: Can I thank Hefin David for that supplementary question, Llywydd, and begin, as I've done before, in thanking him for all the local efforts I know that he makes to promote the help that is available, both from the Welsh Government and also through the fantastic local community effort to which the Member referred? I read with great interest the personal history of Lisa Watkins\u2014how, as a parent, and obliged for other reasons to move from place to place, she found having to replace school uniform every time her children were at a new school a real issue to deal with. And that personal experience motivated her to start up the community interest company that now trades as Caerphilly Uniform Exchange. And the fact that it focuses on recycling school uniforms, both for the cost involved and also because we know that, environmentally, it is far better to be able to reuse and recycle than to buy new each time, is a fantastic service that is being afforded to residents of Hefin David's constituency. As the Member said, Llywydd, these things are replicated elsewhere in other parts of Wales, but I'm sure there's a great deal that can be learned from these local initiatives to make sure that the cost of uniform is never an obstacle to children attending school.\n\n"}

Can I invite firstly Mr Ieuan Evans to introduce himself for the record?\n\nIeuan Evans: Ieuan Evans, chair, Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you very much.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: And, Mr Nigel Walker.\n\nNigel Walker: Nigel Walker, acting chief executive officer of the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you so much. On behalf of Members, I really would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to give evidence today. It's a really important issue; it's something that has the interest of Members of the Senedd, members of the public, and obviously the press and the wider public in Wales. This is something that has come out following the <em>BBC Wales Investigates </em>programme on 23 January. Would you like to make a short opening statement?\n\nIeuan Evans: Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the invitation to appear before the committee this morning. We're very pleased to have the opportunity, and we are aware, as the stewards of Welsh rugby, that we have a great responsibility, and we're aware that we've disappointed the rugby family across Wales. The experience has been sobering for us, but as the new chair, I am determined to make the changes that are necessary to improve rugby in Wales. You will be aware of some of the changes that we have already announced. Also, Nigel has taken the role of acting chief executive.\n\nIeuan Evans: We fully understand and embrace the WRU's unique role in the sporting, economic and civic life in Wales, embedded in its social fabric, and how we project ourselves is critical. We need to get this right; we need to take advice and seek input from others, so we've been working closely with Welsh Government and Sport Wales, and of course, talking to our staff, our players, our member clubs and our commercial partners about the next steps. We are a \u00a3100 million-turnover business, and that includes some public funding. We take our responsibility for spending public funds extremely seriously. We have 80,000 players across 300 clubs, and many more thousands of young people in schools across Wales playing rugby. We're a showcase for Wales to the world. We have a duty, and a responsibility to be as good as we can be, and it's my job to make that happen.Hopefully, today, we can outline for you the changes we have already put in place and answer some of the questions that I'm sure you have. As you know, we will be working with our partners to establish a taskforce with external expertise to help us achieve the cultural change we need, and we'll have more information about that this morning as we finalise some of those details, as they're not all in place as yet. And we've agreed, of course, that Sport Wales will be identifying an independent chair and we will be working with them and the membership in terms of reference for that review, and I'm sure that we can elaborate on that as the hearing goes on. We're happy therefore to provide more details to the committee when those arrangements are finalised.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. So, we'll move on to questions. Why do you think the WRU is in this situation?\n\nIeuan Evans: As a relatively new chair\u2014a matter of weeks\u2014I've been humbled and harrowed by what I've heard, particularly the impact on our female staff and players. I think we all know that we should do more, we need to do more to make the game and our organisation more inclusive, but I was shocked by the personal stories highlighted by our former staff in the programme, and I can only apologise once more to them, and not only them but people elsewhere affected by the allegations in that programme as well, and to say that I will work night and day to ensure that all of our staff feel safe and valued.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. I'll bring Alun Davies in in a moment, but could I just press you on that, because your words are obviously heartfelt, and I appreciate that, but in terms of why you think this has happened, what would be your analysis of that?\n\nNigel Walker: I'm happy to come in there. I think, in any organisation, especially a large organisation like the Welsh Rugby Union, it's possible for things to occur over a period of time and for people to turn a blind eye, and not to address those problems, and then it's not until, sometimes, an organisation is forced to face the reality of the position they find themselves in that they begin to really look deeply and look back to the past and begin to join the dots. So, the warning signs have been there for quite some time. When it's presented as graphically as it was during the BBC Wales programme the week before last, it hits you like a 10-tonne truck.I should offer my apologies. My thoughts are with those members of staff, those players and ex-players who have had an experience that no individual should have. The key now is, yes, we're apologetic, yes, we've made statements, yes, we've accepted that we've got a problem; the key now is to begin to understand the scale and scope of that problem, to seek outside help, which Ieuan has referred to, and to give an undertaking that, when those recommendations come through, whether it's in three months, six months, whenever they come through, we will do everything in our power to implement them, to make sure that the experiences that those women, players, young girls, maybe, have experienced, won't be repeated in the future, or at least you minimise the prospect of those things happening again.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you for that. When you say the very graphic nature of some of these reports that have come out, could you tell us why it took that happening for action to be taken, rather than it happening when these reports had first been made clear to you?\n\nNigel Walker: To be candid, I think, as an organisation, we have been in denial as to the extent of the problem. So, there have been cases in the past that have been dealt with\u2014in theory, dealt with, and people have moved on. I think each individual case is an indication that there has been a wider problem, but people have not joined the dots. When you see it presented over a 30-minute programme in the way that it was, unless you're going to bury your head in the sand for another six months or 12 months, you have to take action, and that's the position we're in. None of us are proud of the position we're in.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. I'm going to bring in Alun.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Thanks very much. Can I challenge you a little bit on your assertion, Mr Evans, that you were shocked by what you've learned? I was reading parts of your autobiography that were scathing about the WRU in different ways. You said that there were people on the WRU who were simply not capable of taking the right decisions because they were too parochial, too insular or just plain short-sighted.&nbsp;You went on to ask how you could have officials from small clubs with no real knowledge of world rugby making decisions that affected the national team, and more often than not affected it for the worse.&nbsp;And you also said, 'At a time when our rivals were planning ahead and learning from the likes of Australia and New Zealand, too many of our people seemed more concerned with ensuring that they had their supply of free tickets and hotel accommodation for international weekend junkets'.Now, that's harsher, in many ways, than anything we've heard in the last week, and that was written some years ago. So, you were clearly aware that there were significant and deep-rooted problems with the WRU, so what you've heard this last week couldn't have shocked you.\n\nIeuan Evans: One of the reasons I came on to the board\u2014and I have been chair for, as I said, a matter of weeks\u2014I've been quite open and candid in my desire to ensure that our organisation is a high-functioning organisation, to drive us to new horizons, and we need to be reflective. My desire\u2014and you've read the press release that went out last night with regard to it\u2014and, as a board, our desire is to convince and compel our member clubs, as we are a union of member clubs and the constitution dictates that clubs need to vote through changes before they can be implemented, that we need to be a diverse, skill set-based board, with an independent chair. I've actively campaigned to find my replacement; we need to have an independent chair. I'm conscious, for us to deliver on our strategic objectives, that we need a board composition overhaul, and it's how we achieve that. We were quite open in the press statement with regard to what we intend to put to the clubs in an extraordinary general meeting at the end of March or earlier. That is our aim, because that's how the organisation needs to be run. Yes, we have a main board, we also have a community game board, which runs the community game with elected representatives from the clubs, and I wish to broaden that and make it a broader church to be truly representative of our game.\n\nAlun Davies AM: I don't disagree with that, but my question was\u2014I think the statement last night was very positive, by the way, I've got no issue about that\u2014my question was about your knowledge about what was happening. You're both giants of our game. You must have had an awareness of what was happening. Your words, Ieuan, were absolutely brutal about the WRU.\n\nNigel Walker: Can I\u2014? Not that Ieuan needs me to defend him, but the words that you've\u2014and I haven't read Ieuan's autobiography, by the way.\n\nAlun Davies AM: Well, you should, it's very illustrative.\n\nNigel Walker: I'm sure that those words were talking in general terms about the running of the organisation. It was the graphic nature of the sexism and misogyny in last week's programme that was the bit that was particularly distressing, talking from my point of view, and I know that Ieuan shares that point of view.\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: There was a review in 2021 into the women's game, could you tell us how the WRU responded to that and would you commit to making those findings public?\n\nNigel Walker: I went through and interview process in May/June 2021. At the latter stages of that process, certain elements of that review were presented to me and it became one of the interview questions: 'What would you do?' I was appointed in July and started in September. When I read the review, I was shocked as to the extent of the problem. There are 40 recommendations in the review, and it was obvious that the Welsh Rugby Union had failed women's rugby. You'll find, during the course of the next 40 minutes, I'm just going to be completely honest with you\u2014\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: We appreciate your honesty.\n\nNigel Walker: So, one of my first tasks was to try to address the problems that were present in the women's game. I remember, even before I took up my appointment formally at the end of September, I addressed the women's squad. They were at the NCE, the national centre of excellence, in Hensol, they were all sitting in front of me, and I apologised. Steve Phillips, the CEO, was next to me. I apologised for what they had been through in the recent past and I said that I was here to make changes and that I would be actively pursuing the prospect of a world class programme for our women players. I said that I would have professional contracts in their hands by the end of December. When I said that, at least half a dozen of them looked up at the ceiling\u2014and I've related this story to them\u2014because they'd heard it all before. But, by December 2021, they had professional contracts. We have made enormous progress against the 40 recommendations. I think the recommendations of that review have been circulated. I'm happy to answer any questions, I can talk about the progress that we've made, and I can talk about the areas that are still to be corrected. But, probably 32 or 33 of those recommendations have been implemented in full\n\nDelyth Jewell AM: Thank you. And the report, it will be published.\n\n"}
